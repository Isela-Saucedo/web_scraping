Four experimental models were used: B-phycoerythrin (BFE) from Porphyridium cruentum, C-phycocyanin (CFC) from Spirulina maxima, double layered rotavirus-like particles (dlRLP) produced in High FiveTM insect cells, and lutein from Chlorella protothecoides. Influence of the system parameters (polymer molecular weight, MW PEG; tie line length, TLL; volume ratio, VR; system pH) upon partition behavior of the selected experimental models. Process conditions for the primary recovery of the products of interest using ATPS were established. Such conditions result in processes with reduced number of stages, which favored high yields. The influence of system parameters upon partition behavior of the four experimental models was correlated with their physicochemical properties, which allowed establishing general rules that facilitate the predictive development of processes for the primary recovery of biological products using SDFA PEG – salt.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1812/906

It carried out in three different mills with different forces. The initial diameters were controlled for both spices and the feeding speed stayed constant: 35.84 Kg/h (sd ± 0.025). In the exit of the mills there was a mesh with a constant diameter of 2 mm; the real energy consumption was evaluated measure the current intensity, the obtained products of the grinding carried out themselves a Sieve Analysis. The smallest diameters were obtained in the Pulvex mill; for the cinnamon were 0.31 mm (sd ± 0.007) and 0.32 mm (sd ± 0.016) for the initial diameter 17.22 and 18.56 mm respectively and the pepper 0.45 mm (sd ± 0.002) y 0.47 mm (sd ± 0.009) for 3.75 y 7.84 mm of initial diameter respectively. The energy consumption was little for the pepper in the Pulvex 0.98 and 0.96 Wh/kg and for the cinnamon were 2.30 and 2.28 Wh/kg in the mill of blades. To conclude, the application of impact and shear forces permit to obtain homogeneous products and facilitate the grinding of the studied spices.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1814/908

At the beginning, the moisture of both varieties of wheat were adjusted to 15 and 20% db and the grains were dried at 40, 60, 70, 80 and 100oC until they reached a final moisture between 11 and 9%. The grains obtained after and before the dried were determined for their hectolitre weight and hardness, and the flours for protein soluble in NaCl. The wheat masses were analyzed with the Swanson mixograph and the bred volume was measured. The results indicated that the dried temperature was the parameter that showed a significant effect in the quality of wheat. In general, both varieties of wheat dried at 40, 60 and 70oC reported similar characteristics of quality those obtained with the respective reference. Otherwise extreme temperatures of 80 and 100oC affected significantly the quality of the wheat. In association with the results obtained we can observe that the wheat with hard texture and strong gluten were more resistant to the heat treatment of dried.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1815/909

The drying conditions were constant temperatures of 40°C, 50°C and 60°C with an airflow of 1.8m/s. Samples of garlic that were fresh, dry, and in the process of drying were frozen in liquid nitrogen before determining their water content. As a reference, samples that were not frozen were monitored at the same time. During the kinetic drying, the samples subjected to cryogenic freezing varied from 0 to 70% in water content compared to those not cryogenically treated. These resultants contrast with those found in wholly dried or wholly fresh samples, which showed a difference of 0.55 and 1.17% respectively. The results suggest that the diverse phenomena which occur during freezing at cryogenic temperatures depend principally on the water content of the material before it is subjected to this process. These variations are highly important if correcting this difference in the dry base water content of physical chemical tests in the process of preservation (e.g. drying), but have little effect when these changes are made in tests with fresh or wholly dried samples.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1816/910

(1999) for three-phase fluidized beds has been evaluated when applied for high pressure and temperature systems. The aforementioned method, which is based on dimensional analysis concepts and model theory, suggests the use of a set of five dimensionless groups that must be matched to ensure hydrodynamic similarity between two separate experimental units that differ both geometrically and in the operating conditions. With the aid of these concepts, in the present work experiments have been carried out with a system operated at atmospheric pressure to simulate the hydrodynamics of an ebullated-bed system operated under severe conditions. The bed porosity and the bed expansion-contraction phenomena have been compared for both systems. On a statistical basis, a good agreement between the bed porosities of both units was observed",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1813/907

WOOD AND KRAFT PULPING PROCESS,"The determination of the chemical composition of the wood is fundamental in the proposition of its most appropriate uses, as in the case of suggesting the wood for the pulping process kraft. The purpose of this work consisted in determining the basic chemical composition of Schinus molle L. wood and to carry out cooking kraft to evaluate the yield and the kappa number. The tree of S. molle belongs to the family Anacardinaceae, which is broadly established in Mexico. The chemical analysis included the determination of pH, ash content, solubility in organic solvents, quantity of lignin and holocellulose. To evaluate the pulp yield and kappa number, a factorial experimental design 2x2x2 was applied, having as factors and levels the following ones: temperature (160, 165 °C), charge of chemical reagents (16, 18%), cooking time (90, 100 min). Finally, based on the results of this work the possible use of this wood for the kraft pulping process is proposed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1817/911

The silica nanoparticles were treated with 10 and 20 wt % of the stearic acid. Nanocomposites with 1, 5 and 7.5 wt % of filler were tested. The effect of stearic acid concentration on the dispersion of silica nanoparticles was investigated. Thermal properties were obtained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties were also determined. It was found that Tg decreased with increasing concentration of stearic acid treated silica or Cloisite 30B content due to plasticization of the PC matrix. A fact that is attributed to the presence of increasing concentrations of stearic acid or the tensoactive used in the nanoclay. On the other hand, it was found that the tensile modulus, E, and storage modulus, E’, increased with increasing content of silica with additive or Cloisite 30B. This behavior was attributed to an increase in stiffness of the nanocomposite owing to nanoparticles concentration and an improved distribution in the PC matrix of silica treated with stearic acid. However, it was observed that the thermal stability of the nanocomposites, decreases as the concentration of treated silica with stearic acid or Cloisite 30B increases in the composite.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1819/915

Simulation results obtained with different kinetic equations (power-law type, PLT and diffusion-integration equations, DIE) are compared against experimental results. The crystallization process is modeled by a set of algebraic-integral-differential equations that represent the mass, energy and population balances; and it is solved using the method of lines. The results show that PLT equations generate values for the state variables that are closer to experimental information than results obtained with DIE. Further, it is clear that DIE equations require parameters that change according to process conditions",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1820/916

This paper presents an efficient methodology for the analysis and retrofit of multi-contaminant wastewater treatment systems which involve a single treatment unit. The developed methodology is based on a non linear programming model that captures the topological and operational features of a treatment superstructure, which contains all possible layouts for the treatment system, and incorporates a recycle stream that strengthens the system’s contaminant removal capabilities. The developed nonconvex mathematical model is accompanied by a non deterministic, but very reliable solution strategy that conducts a systematical exploration of the search space, in the pursuit for global optimal solutions. A case study that includes both, the analysis, and the retrofit of an existing wastewater treatment system, under current and foreseeable contaminant concentration limits, is utilized to illustrate the proposed methodology.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1818/912
