In this work the importance of cometabolism in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the environment is discussed, due to hydrocarbons are the most common groundwater and soil pollutants. Varieties of kinetic equations, Monod or like Michaeles-Menten expressions that have been used to describe cometabolism are discussed; these models assumed that biodegradation takes place as single substrate and the interaction of growth- and non-growth substrate are described as toxic effect or competitive imhibition. Finally, the applicability of the cometabolism for in situ bioremediation is discussed, Methyl tert-Butyl Ether- and halogenated hydrocarbons are the most widespread studied compounds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1784/886

The IJ production kinetics was well modelled through a re-parameterised 3-parameter Gompertz model with kinetic parameters: IJ-lag phase, λIJ(d), maximum IJ-stage conversion rate, mmax(≡[d(CIJ/CIJ,0)/dt]max) (d-1), and IJ-multiplication factor, (CIJ/CIJ,0)max(-), with values within the ranges 14 d < λIJ< 16 d; 33 d-1< mmax< 241 d-1and 66 (-) < (CIJ/CIJ,0)max< 611 (-), respectively. It was apparent that maximum values of mmaxand (CIJ/CIJ,0)maxwere obtained in medium A4 (27.6 % (v/v) agave juice, 1.7 % (w/v) yeast extract, 1.2 % (w/v) dried egg yolk, 2.5 % (v/v) corn oil). Also, the maximum average IJ concentration (249,444 per mL) was achieved in A4- fermentations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1796/895

Mexican foods were selected including different characteristics, they were characterized in fresh form as well as frozen; moisture, freezing point and freezing time, color, density, thermal properties and texture were determined. Moisture ranged from 13 to 97%, freezing point varied from -0.10°C for nopal to -35.2°C for “mole” paste; in general, for freezing time evaluation of the studied foods, Plank´s model was better than Salvadori and Mascheroni equation. Net color of foods based on Hunter parameters showed low changes during storage. Density was constant did not showing significant effect of storage time. Thermal conductivity ranged from 0.07 for fresh “hojaldra” to 0.49 W/m°C for “nogada”, changing their values in frozen samples that changed from 0.06 for bread to 1.51 W/m°C for nopal. Thermal conductivity for most of the foods was predicted by Spells equation with error less than 25%. Food texture was the most affected property.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1804/900

Apple slabs were dehydrated in an experimental drying tunnel using a factorial design 42. Independent variables were airflow (1, 2, 3 and 4 m/s) and drying air temperature (50, 60, 70 and 80 °C). Relative shrinkage (A/Ao) was evaluated during drying as the ratio of the projected (top view) area of slab at any time during the process (A) to the initial area (Ao) of the same slab. In five punctual measuring zones on the surface of the slab, surface temperatures (ST) and moisture contents (MC) were evaluated. ST and MC were different for each measuring zone, causing irregular dehydration. Fractal analysis was used to evaluate the non-linear (A/Ao) observed pattern and ST distribution. Fractal dimensions for (A/Ao) ratios (FDA) and ST (FDST) were 1.08-1.30 and 1.12-1.54 respectively. Temperatures of 60º and 70ºC, and airflows of 2 and 3 m/s caused the highest irregularity of shrinkage and highest FDAand FDSTvalues. Scanning electron microscopy images for measuring zone were captured and fractal dimension of texture of images were obtained (FDSDBC) it was observed that nonlinear shrinkage was related to irregular microstructure given by FDSDBC.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1805/901

The catalytic activity of allosteric enzymes depends on the concentration of a certain regulating compound. A simgoidal saturation curve is a characteristic of the enzymes that exert allosteric control of reaction rates. These enzymes are rather large enzymatic complexes usually composed of at least one catalytic subunit and a regulatory fraction, and the complex catalytic activity is given by the cooperative interactions between those enzymatic subunits. Realistic simulation of biocatalytic allosteric phenomena requires an appropiate modelling of the enzyme kinetic behavior. Modelling enzymes with cooperative kinetics can be achieved by defining interacting agents. Agent-based modelling allows an accurate representation of sigmoidal saturation curves, without the kinetic parameters that are needed in other kinetic models. Experimental data from Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase are compared to theoretical results from different models for allosteric systems. Results from agent-based modelling show a good agreement with experimental saturation curves",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1799/897

The model is based on an open system representing the surface of the metallic matrix and the electrolyte. The galvanic action at microscopic scale is described by a system of equations that meets thermal diffusion and chemical co diffusion effects with entropy production due to both heat and diffusion fluxes. The application of the model requires an experimental validation on which adequate values for the phenomenological coefficients were found. The heterogeneous nature of the grains arrangement on the carbon steel surface corresponds to a heterogeneous mechanism of galvanic action so that the resulting engineering parameters are mean values of the magnitude on the extensive properties of the system",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1800/898

In this paper it’s been studied the effect of the implementation of the maximum displacement of the vacuum pump profile, obtaining a 56.39% of performance against the obtained results in the crystallization by cooling off. It’s been tested also, different steam pressures in the jacket, observing that applying a steam pressure of 0.15 kg/cm2, at a saturated solution in 35°C, it can be obtained a formed crystal mass 39% of performance against the obtained results in the crystallization by cooling off, with a average crystal diameter of 414.7153μm., a standard deviation of 57.5629μm, average evaporated flow was 13.1619 ml/min, On the basis of the obtained results it can be concluded that, the implementation of the vacuum profiles improves and the diminishing of the steam pressure, in combination with the warming time, improves considerably the crystallization process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1806/902

Yeast biomass production processes aim at inducing an intracellular accumulation of trehalose. However, during a production process, the trehalose must be quantified by off-line analytical methods after sample taking because it is a cytoplasmic compound. Thus, knowing experimental measurements of yeast trehalose content is always delayed. As a result, not oportune actions can be implemented in order to lead the production process toward a high intracellular trehalose accumulation in the produced biomass. Therefore, an online estimation method to forecast real-time intracellular trehalose content in yeast is developed. It is based on the main metabolic events involved in trehalose biosynthesis, as well as on a differential neural network algorithm to estimate trehalose concentration in the cytoplasm",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1807/903

The procedure was applied to experimental conversion data of hexyl methacrylate (C6MA) and styrene (STY) in MEP. It was found that: (i) nucleation rate is not linear with time, opposed to previous reports, (ii) coagulation rate is negligible, (iii) micelles provide monomer to reacting particles, (iv) a vitreous effect, even in polymers with a Tg lower than the reaction temperature, was found, (v) radical entry to particles is negligible confirming previous reports, (vi) the decreasing reaction rate interval, besides monomer depletion, is caused by a decrease in active reaction sites, and (vii) a three-parameter phenomenological model is presented capable of describing the studied systems.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1810/904

One of the main features of this observer is that it uses an uncertain mathematical model of the process, whose uncertainty belongs to the multiplicative type. The performance of the proposed observer was firstly evaluated by means of numerical simulations and also by using experimental data obtained from a copolymerization reaction between styrene and butyl acrylate, performed in a prototype experimental reactor. Both the results obtained in the numerical simulations and in the experiments; show that the proposed observer may be used as a observer-based monitoring system.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1811/905
