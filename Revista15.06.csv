Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Debris flows analysis based on dendrochronological approach at Ixtacamaxtitlán, Sierra Norte de Puebla, Mexico","Owing to their potential consequences, such as the disaster triggered by hundreds of landslides in October 1999 in the mountain range Sierra Norte de Puebla, mass movement processes are among the most significant geomorphological hazards in Mexico. In this paper, we presented the reconstruction and analysis of debris flows at two valleys located on the Tenextepecuaco mountain in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, based on geomorphologic and dendrogeomorphic methods. From 37Juniperus deppeanatrees we made a Local Reference Chronology, also to dating and mapping the debris flow events and finally for determine the stability/instability of the landforms using the age of the trees. The comparative analysis of the maximum rainfall series in 24 hours, for the period from May to October from 1992 to 2013, and the tree-ring width index suggested that in August 2007 and August 2010 two channels of the western valley were reactivated triggered by heavy rainfall amounting 93 and 56 mm, respectively. As a result of such event, some tree-rings series recorded a growth suppression, and that was also observed in satellite images by Google Earth through changes in the vegetation cover. Other trees showed a less growth suppressions in 2013 and the channels were kept active. Since 2014, some trees showed a growth release, and recolonization of trees was also identified in the satellite imagery by Google Earth, suggesting an apparent geomorphological stability. The applied methodology showed the potential ofJuniperus deppeanato be used for dendrogeomorphic studies in México, also in others geomorphic context. Additionally, particular results of the study can contribute to the existing efforts on prevention and mitigation of natural hazards within the regional context.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1556/1386

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"U-Pb geochronology of rutile: deciphering the cooling history of the Oaxacan Complex granulites, southern Mexico","Rutile (TiO2) is a heavy mineral, commonly found as accessory in many lithologies, such as basic igneous rocks, high-grade metamorphic units, as well as a detritus in sedimentary clastic rocks. Its chemical composition is sensitive to the crystallization environment, allowing a characterization of either metabasic or metasedimentary protoliths in metamorphic rocks. Thanks to the capability to accept U in its crystalline network, at least in metasedimentary, high-grade protoliths, rutile can be dated by U-Pb geochronology. Furthermore, its closure temperature ofca.600 °C for the U-Pb system makes rutile a suitable chronometer, complementary to zircon, to unravel provenance and exhumation paths in both sedimentary siliciclastic cover and basement units. Besides, the Zr-in thermometer allows for a very precise calculation of the rutile crystallization temperature.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1557/1388

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Necrosols characterization in the dry tropical forest in Colombia: an approach from forensic geology,"Necrosols are soils related to burials, as inhumation conditions produce particular changes in their environment. Consequently, this study using forensic geoscience techniques makes it possible to maximize the effective search for clandestine burials. This constitutes a discipline with few academic initiatives in Latin America. The investigation of our project arose from exhumations of three rural cemeteries that took place when changes in land use of the Ituango hydroelectric project in the Cauca river canyon in Colombia, flooded the communities. During the exhumation process, the description and sampling of the profiles within the 3 cemeteries was carried out. Likewise, natural profiles were described and sampled in the surroundings of 2 out of 3 cemeteries, to determine the variations of the micromorphological and chemical properties resulting from the effect of the burials. The soil samples were analyzed with chemical and micromorphological methods. The study objective was the identification of differences between the natural and intervened soils, in order to propose features and pedo-anthropogenic processes that characterize the studied Necrosols. The results show clear differences between the cemetery soils, with respect to their natural counterparts. In consequence we found coffin wood and bone microfragments, minerals with parallel orientations, and high concentration of roots at the burial level and pedogenic aggregates mixtures incorporated into non-pedogenic matrix. From the chemical point of view, the Necrosols compared to natural soils, show highest concentration of S, mobile Fe, P, in addition to the increase of the soil cation exchange capacity. The present study demonstrated the usefulness of micromorphology as a powerful tool in confirming the presence of Necrosols with methods used in forensic archeology and geoscience. In accordance with the objective set out in this work, it was possible to characterize particular micromorphological and chemical properties in Necrosols to determine pedo-anthropogenic features and processes. The observed results in the Necrosols of three cemeteries in the tropical dry forest in Colombia could be proposed as model diagnostic features for the identification of clandestine burials; particularly for areas that meet similar pedological, geomorphological, and bioclimatic contexts. This could be useful in forensic geoscience.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1539/1390

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Radon (222Rn) gas concentrations in soil from the urban area of Morelia, Michoacán, and their relation with potentially seismic faults and with faults associated to subsidence-creep processes","The objective of this investigation is to know the soil concentration levels of Radon gas (222Rn) in the urban area in the City of Morelia, Michoacán, México and its relationship with geological faults: potentially active faults and those associated with subsidence-creep-fault process. The average measurement of the Radon gas concentration of 86 stations distributed in the city of Morelia is 4,028.56 Bq/m3. In addition, a variographic analysis was carried out for222Rn gas concentrations data to determine the possible existence of anisotropy. From this analysis it is inferred that the Radon gas in the city of Morelia presents a hybrid anisotropy, with preferential direction to the N50°E, which indicates that its spatial distribution is driven by the extensional stress field on the Morelia-Acambay fault system (s2=NE-SW y s3=NW-SE).",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1547/1391
