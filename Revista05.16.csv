The test temperatures were 25, 50, 60, 70 and 80ºC. The main objective was to determine the type of corrosion and corrosion kinetics under the mentioned conditions. The results of the noise signals together with the micrographic observations showed that at 25 and 50ºC the corrosion process was mixed. At 60, 70 and 80ºC the corrosion process was a kind of mixed corrosion, but with a trend to suffer pitting corrosion. A statistical analysis to the current and potential time series was made to obtain the noise resistance Rn, and the Stern-Geary equation and Faraday Law were applied to determine the corrosion rates. In general, it was observed that corrosion rates for SS-304 increased with temperature, and the corrosion process was localized and mixed. The application of electrochemical techniques as well as the conventional method led to obtain the corrosion performance of the SS-304 under similar experimental conditions than that observed in heat pumps, and it contributed in the understanding of corrosion mechanism suffered by this stainless steel. This research also helped in the material selection for the design and construction of heat pumps.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1867/959

Based on pressure probe measurements the impact on bed expansion, bubble size and distribution in the bed, and on gas backmixing has been evaluated. It has been found that the presence of tubes can reduce the size of bubbles and their distribution in the bed. It was also observed that both bed expansion and gas backmixing ocurred at a lower extent in the beds with tubes than in the open beds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1861/953

Nonetheless, the easiness of regulation of important operating states depends on dynamic features related to operating conditions, design of the control and the relationship between them. There have been several attempts to develop systematic evaluation of control schemes; however nonlinearities of this kind of systems have made it a complicated issue. Dynamic interactions among variables play important roles when control actions are applied. Especially, in partial-controlled systems some uncontrolled variables may exhibit unexpected behaviour for certain operating conditions or control actions, such as inverse response, depending on the selection of measured and manipulated variables. In this work, a simple proposition for the evaluation of pairs of control and manipulated variables is developed for chemical reacting systems. Although it is based in research on phenomena such as the nonlinear relationship between zero dynamics and the Lyapunov stability of control, the resulting strategy is simple, easy to understand and easy to apply for the analysis of nonlinear lumped parameter systems which have control affine structure. Results obtained go beyond the ones obtained by using Relative Gain Array analysis applied to nonlinear systems, because the methodology developed is applicable to systems which are partially controlled. Furthermore, this strategy is independent of the controller used. As example, the methodology is used in the evaluation of two control policy options for regenerators of industrial fluid catalytic cracking adiabatic units; results obtained were probed with industrial operating data.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1870/960

The effect of the feed components and compositions of the mixture were studied. It was found that savings of 15% in the total annual cost can be obtained in the heat-integrated distillation sequence in a very restricted case despite energy savings of up to 50%. This is due to higher operational pressures in the heat-integrated distillation sequence which increase the temperatures in the reboilers. As a result, the choice of the heat-integrated distillation sequence should be made in terms of the total annual cost instead of the energy saved.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1862/956

The mathematical model to study this problem is based on conservation equations in terms of average variables, and considers the convection and conduction heat transfer mechanisms in two dimensions, cylindrical coordinates because of the annular geometry, and transient regime. It is assumed that the fluid flow is described by use of Darcy’s law. Under conditions of drilling fluid losses and short times, the convective heat transfer effect is more important than the conductive mechanism, while for the same conditions and larger times the conductive effect governs the heat transfer process throughout the porous media",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1871/962

In addition, full-milk fat (FFC) and low-milk fat (LFC) Panela type cheeses were manufactured from milk containing 27 and 6.8 g L-1 of milk-fat (MF), respectively. After 72 h of storage (4 ºC), the cheese systems were subjected to proximal chemical analysis, instrumental texture determination and microstructure observation using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The cheese systems showed differences in their chemical composition, structural arrangement and textural characteristics, due to chemical composition variation of the milk from which they were elaborated. Complete substitution of MF by emulsified CO, resulted in cheese-like products having a highly porous protein network, interrupted by numerous small drops of oil. P contributed to the openness of the protein network of the cheese-like products conferring it the ability to retain greater initial amounts of whey in comparison with those retained into the protein network of the FFC. Polynomial models that estimated the textural characteristics of the cheese systems as a function of P, CO and MF concentrations in the milk used to prepare them. Increases in the concentration of P, CO and MF were related with lower values of hardness and chewiness, whilst lower springiness values in the cheese systems were associated with increasing of the P and MF concentrations. The cohesiveness of the cheese systems was negatively affected by CO.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1873/963
