The aim of this study was to optimize the experimental conditions for the selective labeling of alpha-synuclein with dansyl chloride, an environment sensitive probe that reacts selectively with free amino groups in proteins allowing characterization of lipidprotein interactions or protein-protein interactions of alpha-synuclein in lipoprotein complexes.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1004/366

In this system, surface cultures of Aspergillus niger were supplied with 1.2 g total glucose but with dierent agar depths, H: 1.2, 2.3, 3.5 and 4.6 cm. Experimental variables were, surface uptake of glucose, biomass production, citric acid production and carbon dioxide as well as the final height of mycelia. The results show a positive linear correlation between S 0 and average glucose flux (JS ) as well as the respiratory rate, Rc. However, the flux of biomass (JX) and citric acid (JP) are negatively correlated to substrate initial concentration (S 0). The results suggest that carbon fate in these surface cultures depends on the magnitude of substrate influx to the fungal mat and the substrate uptake seems to be controlled by the rate of diusion of substrate of the medium to the surface of culture. Such results support the need to understand the importance of JS , in order to control carbon fate in fungal surface cultures.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1008/369

A culture medium based in glucose, yeast extract and mineral salts including copper sulfate as laccases inductor, was used in all grown systems. Very different activity levels were observed depending on the growth system and in all cases the zymogram patterns were similar. So, in this strain, the number of isoenzymes was independent of culture conditions but their amount changed, showing the highest values in the culture in shake flasks followed by the solid-state fermentation, followed by stirred tank reactor and the lowest activity was observed in airlift reactor. It is suggested that the difference in laccase activity could be due to the type of growth given in each system, the pellets by their small size are the metabolically more active compared to the big mass produced in the airlift reactor; although the stirred tank showed small pieces of mycelium, not showed an adequate growth by mechanical damage to cells. In the case of solid culture, the fungus growth was in mycelium form which is similar to its natural habitat",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1015/372

In products derived from each method were evaluated the percentages of demineralization, deproteinization and color changes. The results showed that at 120 h of SSF with strain L. plantarum BG-112 were obtained 32.43% and 32.63% of deproteinization and 40.31% and 15.40% of demineralization with grasshopper and shrimp respectively. The alkalineacid treatment produced 98.19% and 96.75% of deproteinization and 98.91% and 92.66% of demineralization with these substrates. Finally, using ultrasonication (40% of amplitude), the deproteinization achieved was 64.58% and 61.12% and presented a demineralization of 13.71% and 12.29% in grasshopper and shrimp exoskeletons. Chemical treatment showed a greater protein and mineral removal compared to other treatments with a process time of 5 h, and chitin yields achieved were 51.94% (grasshopper) and 47.68% (shrimp). However, the application of ultrasonic waves allowed the extraction of protein and minerals in a shorter time (2 h), and on wet basis chitin yields were estimated as 75.3% and 74.02% from grasshoper and shrimp exoskeletons.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1020/376

In the present work, the pigment extraction yield of seven Mexican accessions of Bixa orellana was quantified. Also color parameters and content of tocotrienols, tocopherols, norbixin, bixin, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were evaluated in the corresponding annatto extracts. The highest percentage of pigment extraction yield was obtained with KOH (4.84%). Accessions 43 (L*= 4.01 ± 0.79, C*= 7.33 ± 1.07, h= 25.76 ± 6.35) and 50 (L*= 3.17 ± 0.64, C*= 6.81 ± 0.53, h= 26.41 ± 4.41) had the lowest color values, meaning these accessions had a darker and redder color. Four accessions showed the highest content of bixin: accession 48 (3.1%), 45 (2.6%) 43 (2.4%) and 47 (2.2%). Accession 50 had showed the highest content of total phenolic compounds and of tocotrienols (T3), mainly the isoform δ-T3 (5.03 ± 0.64 mg g−1 Seed Dry Weight), as well as the highest antioxidant capacity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1021/377

In this study, the quantification of free thiols by using Ellman’s reagent was validated to demonstrate, that the Filgrastim contained in the Filatil® exhibits the same amount of disulfide bonds than its reference product under both native and denaturing-reducing conditions. The validation exercise demonstrated to be suitable for its intended use. The comparability exercise for this attribute showed no significant differences (p=1.000; α , 0.05) in free cysteines content among the two evaluated products. These results provide evidence of similitude for this attribute, which along with an extended comparability exercise for other physicochemical characteristics, contribute to the demonstration of similarity among the physicochemical and functional properties set as critical quality attributes for Filgrastim according to the regulatory guidelines.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1025/379

The dry weight yields of chitin and chitosan were 10.4 and 8.1% respectively. Chitin and chitosan were characterized by infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform, X-ray diraction, scanning electron microscopy, potentiometric titration and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography; they were compared with commercial chitin and chitosan. The results showed that the obtained chitin and chitosan had chemical structures comparable to commercial polymers, with similar physicochemical properties; the obtained chitosan had a deacetylation degree of 87 % and high molecular weight (25.8 kDa).

The kinetic parameters were estimated using a modified genetic algorithm. The results obtained by simulations provide a good fitting to the experimental data, indicating an optimum pH of 7.12 and qmax = 0.15 g Ac g X−1 day−1 . The anodic biofilm shows slow growth kinetics, meaning that the substrate concentration gradients were important up until the final stage of growth and showing prevalence of active biomass up to 22 micrometers away from the electrode. The increase of the current density obtained is associated with the increase of the biofilm thickness",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1032/385

The extraction was done by agitated maceration using hydro-ethanolic mixtures as solvent. Optimal conditions were identified by a response surface method (RSM) approach with a 33factorial design. The process variables evaluated were the temperature, solvent concentration and average particle size. The response variables were the concentration of total phenols and antioxidant capacity. The effect of process variables for both response variables was statistically significant. The total concentration of phenols, measured under optimum conditions, was used to determine the best processing time. The experimental data for phenol concentration fitted to a second order kinetics model. By comparison, to Rosmarinus officinalis, the relative contents of oregano extracts, on total phenols (143.8%) and on antioxidant capacity (90.6 %) obtained by hydro-ethanolic maceration at optimal conditions show that Mexican oregano is an alternative source for phenolic substances with high antioxidant capacity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1034/386

Diamante 22,"Acetylation is a chemical modification by esterification which causes in the starch granules changes in the structure and consequently in its functional characteristics. In this study to evaluate the effect of the modification, native cassava starch (NCS) and yam (NYS) were used with acetic anhydride at different reaction times (10 to 240 min). Significant differences were found in the degree of substitution (DS) in relation to the reaction time and the species into study (p <0.05). Through Analysis by Fourier transform infrared, the modification was proved where a signal to 1087 cm-1 corresponding to stretching C-O bond of acetyl groups was found. Diffraction patterns exhibited after the modification were very similar to the native, wherein the native cassava starch presents type A pattern and native yam starch type B pattern. The micrographs showed minor lacerations from the modification in the surface of the granules. The functional properties such as water absorption, solubility and swelling power increased when the degree of substitution increased. The introduction of acetyl groups in the starch structure, caused a decrease in gelatinization temperature, greater stability and tendency to retrogradation",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1037/387

The BBPH was obtained using sequential pepsin-pancreatin enzymatic system. The ACE-I inhibitory activity was measured using tripeptide hippurylhistidyl leucine (HHL) as model peptide. Three microcapsule formulations were prepared containing BBPH and EGLD at ratios of 1:20, 1:4 and 1:1, respectively. The physicochemical characteristics of microcapsules were evaluated by optical (OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), dierential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). ACE-I inhibitory activity of BBPH was IC50=0.42 mg/mL. All microcapsules showed irregular shapes. The BBPH was distributed homogeneously in all formulations. The DSC and XRD analysis revealed a uniform dispersion of the BBPH and partially crystalline structures of EGLD and BBPH. The FT-IR confirmed the chemical stability of BBPH in the microcapsules.

To decrease the particle size, a bentonite solution was centrifuged, recovering only the supernatant (treated bentonite), both control and treated bentonite solutions (0.025 g bentonite / g water) were characterized using atomic force and confocal microscopy. Six solutions, named as C (100, 25, 0, 0, 0), TA (100, 25, 8.47, 0, 0), B (100, 25, 0, 16.83, 0), TB (100, 25, 0, 0, 16.83), O (100, 25, 8.47, 16.83, 0) and TO (100, 25, 8.47, 0, 16.83) g / 4500 g water, prepared with gelatin, glycerol, tannic acid, control bentonite, and treated bentonite respectively, were subjected to rheological tests (flow curves and viscoelasticity). The treatment of bentonite reduced the particle size about 200 nm. The solutions O and TO showed shear-thinning behavior (n < 1) with higher moduli (G’ and G”) values, than C, TA, B and TB at both 10 and 25 °C.

We designed and developed an experimental culture medium (ECM) from hydrolysed avocado seeds, supplemented with M9 salts (10% v/v). Breaking of starch granules of avocado seeds due to hydrolysis treatments was analysed by morphology and morphometry of granules. We evaluated the ECM functionality by measuring the growth of E. coli as aected by (i) the carbon source (reducing sugars concentration), (ii) the nitrogen source, and (iii) mixing and aeration in a stirred tank bioreactor. ECM containing 13.33 and 20 g/L of reducing sugars reached a biomass production of 1.75 and 2.22 gDCW/L, respectively. Interestingly, the biomass yield from ECM was at least 2.5-fold higher than that obtained using Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) medium (0.23 vs 0.09). In addition, the growth rate increased with the agitation velocity (0.44 h-1 at 200 rpm; 0.36 h-1 at 150 rpm). Our findings suggest that avocado seeds represent a cost-eective material for producing a sustainable culture medium for bacterial growth of E. coli and other strains of interest in biotechnological processes",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1046/393

Cell surface hydrophobicity was of 22.8±2.9%, zeta potential values were negative and pHdependent (- 27±0.7mV, pH 5.0; -33±0.9mV; pH 6.0). Yeast-Cd interaction occurred in the first 5 min of incubation with a ζ decrease up to 11 units. Cadmium removal effciency (CIC) was dependent of water pH and Cd initial concentration (IC). CIC was higher (p < 0.05) at pH 6.0 and IC [5 mg / L]. Under these conditions Cd removal was of 3.8±0.01 mg/L. (76%). Changes observed in FT-IR spectra involved carboxyl, amide and phosphate groups with yeast-Cd interaction. The SEM micrograph of yeast cells exposed to Cd showed variation on morphology, surface rugosity and loss of cell contact without changes in cell size (3.3±0.6µm). Adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for growth in Cd was observed.

Pectin and xanthan gum solutions were found to be Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. The effect of the temperature on the viscosity of pectin solutions and the consistency index (K) of xanthan gum were modeled by the Arrhenius equation. The xanthan gum/pectin mixtures predominantly behaved as pseudoplastic fluids and were described by the power law model. Mathematical models were developed to predict the flow behavior index and the consistency index as a function of the blends composition, at the studied temperature. The activation energy of flow was expressed in terms of the concentrations of the components of the mixtures.

For both series of microemulsions theeffectof the type of surfactant on: the water in oil ratio; droplet size; amount of surfactant required and stability of the microemulsions was studied. The microemulsions employing SDS form larger drops, although require lower amount of surfactant. Microemulsions formed were stable for up to thirty days. Two CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts with the same metal composition were prepared using either surfactant, and were used in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene. The catalyst prepared with CTAB presented a greater surface area and catalytic activity, than that prepared with SDS in the microemulsions. Product distribution in HDS followed the trend biphenyl > cyclohexylbenzene > bicyclohexyl for both catalysts suggesting the direct desulfurization route. The study suggests that the layer formed by the surfactant and organic agent, around the micelles, plays a role that determines the properties of the catalyst. The results allowed to suggest the mechanism of formation of the catalyst prepared by reverse microemulsion using CTAB as surfactant",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1075/401

This has required the development and implementation of new technologies and chemical formulations to enhance the transport of heavy oil. When flow improvers are injected in a crude stream, it generally does not mix due to its different density and viscosity properties, and the laminar flow regime in the pipe. However, depending on the characteristics of the jet (momentum and turbulence), a mixing might take effect downstream, or a liquid-liquid stratified flow may occur in the fully developed region. Although this behavior can affect the corresponding pressure drop, the transition that occurs from the injection point to the fully developed region has been little studied. Based on conservation of momentum, a mathematical model has been developed to describe the temporal behavior of the velocity profile, where there is no mixing between the oil and the improver, i.e. the fluids are considered immiscible. The model solution shows that the injection into a point very near the tube wall is the best option to reduce pressure drop",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1077/402

The IVAKY was built based on a geomorphopedological map scale of 1:50 000, which contains the density and type of karst depressions and soil associations in each geomorphopedological unit. The climate factor is included through the length of the rainy period that considers amount, distribution and intensity of the rain. The three factors (topography, soils and climate) were weighted with the process of hierarchical analysis (AHP) using ArcGis 9.1. It was identified that the ring of sinkholes and part of the northeast of Yucatan state have the extreme level of vulnerability, where dominated sinkholes in contact with the aquifer and soil as Nudilithic Leptosols, Lithic Leptosols and Rendzic Leptosols, occupying 19% of the state surface. Low and very low levels of vulnerability are located in southern Yucatan in areas of equal or greater than 50 masl, with low to medium density of karstic depressions (uvala and poljes) and Luvisols, Vertisols and Stagnosols associated with Leptosols ( 12% of the statesurface).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1081/403

The improvement included: (1) reuse of CALB in the presence of ethanol (EtOH), (2) reuse of CALB in the presence of methanol (MeOH), (3) blended alcohols at different molar ratios (0:100, 20:80, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 80:20 and 100:0, %EtOH:%MeOH), and employing second generation raw materials: waste cooking oil (WCO) and castor oil (CO). When the first strategy was carried out the FAEE (fatty acid ethyl ester) content achieved was 96% in a first cycle but after four cycles the percentage decreased to 32%. For the second strategy the FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) content attained was 63% in a first cycle but after four cycles the percentage was only 13.5%.

Sugar cane industry must redesign the production processes, including new emerging technologies, in order to retain the status of competitive industry. The integration is a complex process accomplish by engineers where de main problems are alternative generation and alternative comparing. Engineers must execute several subtasks like: factory retrofit, macro-localization, dynamic indicators computing and so on. Processes engineer is complex, so, a good computation support is needed. In this work we state that existent tools are not enough to accomplish this supporting. In this paper we analyze industrial integration like a process, composite by several decisions, executed by engineers. Useful computational technologies and methods are presented. These methods are our bricks for a tool supporting every single process engineer task. Some of the presented methods had been used previously but need to be adapted to this industry. Our approach is not only to integrate existent tools o creating new tools but automating most decision making. Finally, we show a typical case of sugar cane industry integration. In this case several modifications are needed in order to be competitive; engineers must select raw  aterials and technologies to use in the production of furfural, ethanol and citric acid. The technologies involved in this case can use sugar molasses, bagasse and sugar cane straw as raw material.

It is well known that the control of biological process presents several diffculties due to the sensitivity of the biological system parameters, making the control task an interesting problem to solve. An optimal tracking control strategy together with a robust control is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem. The presence of unknown elements and input disturbance were also considered on the control design. In order to prove stability results, Lyapunov techniques were utilized. A new control tuning strategy for systems with stable properties was developed.

In addition, it is proposed an alternative method for estimating the metastable zone width based on the solution density measured online. The apparent nucleation order is evaluated using the Nývlt equation. Experimental results showed that initial composition and cooling rate had significant effects on the metastable zone width. An increment in cooling rate increased the metastable zone width and an increment in initial composition decreased the metastable zone width. On the other hand, it was found that online density measurements could be used as an alternate method for estimating the metastable zone width.
