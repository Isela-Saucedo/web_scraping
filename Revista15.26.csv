Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Genesis of manganese oxide mineralization in the Boleo region and  Concepción Peninsula, Baja California Sur: constraints  from Pb-Sr isotopes and REE geochemistry",Manganese oxide mineralization on the eastern coast of Baja California Sur is intimately related  to the Neogene tectonic evolution of the Gulf of California. Manganese is closely associated with the Cu- Co-Zn mineralization of the Boleo district and nearby deposits of Santa Rosalía region and Concepción peninsula. Trace element and rare earth element geochemistry of the manganese oxides provides  clear evidence of a hydrothermal origin and excludes the hydrogenous nature for these deposits. Lead  isotope data suggest that metal sources for the manganese mineralization along the eastern coast Baja  California Sur are mostly the Miocene Andesite of Sierra Santa Lucía volcanics and the Peninsular  Ranges batholith rocks. The strontium isotope data indicate that the mineralizing fluids involved in the  manganese mineralization from Boleo district resulted from the interaction of two end-members: (1) the  Sierra Santa Lucía volcanic rocks and (2) the gypsum member of the Boleo Formation. The geological  observations and the available isotope and geochronological data suggest a southward migration of the  hydrothermal processes in response to the evolving tectonic context of the opening of the Gulf of California,,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/130/121
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Heat and mass fluxes monitoring of El Chichón crater lake,"El Chichón crater lake is characterized by important variations in volume (40,000 m3 to 230,000  m3) and in chemical composition alternating between acid-sulfate and acid-chloride-sulfate composition  (Cl–/SO42– = 0–79 molar ratio). These variations in volume can occur very fast within less than a few weeks,  and are not always directly correlated with the precipitation rate; the seepage rate of lake water is also an important parameter to consider in the lake mass balance. In this study, we present for the first time  continuous physical data (temperature, depth, precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation) of the crater  lake registered by a meteorological station and two dataloggers. A heat and mass balance approach is  proposed to estimate the heat and mass fluxes injected into the lake by the sublacustrine fumaroles and  springs. Tracing the evolution of such fluxes can be helpful to understand this highly dynamic lake and offers an efficient way of monitoring the volcanic activity. During the observation period, the hydrothermal  heat flux was estimated to be 17–22 MW, and the mass flux 10–12 kg/s (error on both values of ± 15%).  These fluxes are mainly counterbalanced by the loss of heat and mass by evaporation, respectively of  20–24 MW and 8–10 kg/s. Furthermore, the seepage rate of the lake waters was estimated and shown to  be a highly variable parameter (12–42 kg/s), depending on the lake surface. This new data set constitutes  a baseline to monitor the future activity of El Chichón volcano. In case of volcanic activity renewal, one  of the first precursor signals would probably be the full evaporation of the lake.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/131/122
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Características microtexturales como indicadores del transporte y  emplazamiento de dos depósitos de avalancha de escombros  del Volcán de Colima (México),"During its history Colima volcano has experienced numerous partial edifice sector collapses with  the emplacement of debris avalanche deposits (DAD) of contrasting volume, morphology and texture.  A previous detailed stratigraphic study in the southeastern sector of the volcano described by Roverato  et al. (2011, J. Volc. Geoth. Res., 207, 33-46) allowed the recognition of two debris avalanche deposits  named San Marcos DAD (SM-DAD V= ~1.3 km3) and Tonila DAD (T-DAD V= ~1 km3). Radiocarbon  dates of organic material, directly associated with these deposits, gave ages of >28 kyr cal. BP for the  SM-DAD and ~15 kyr cal. BP for the T-DAD. The San Marcos collapse was promoted by ongoing volcano- tectonic deformation. The failure event triggered a “dry” debris avalanche (water content <10%). In  contrast, the Tonila failure occurred in “wet” paleoclimate conditions during a period characterized by high humidity; the fact that the volcanic system was partially water-saturated was an important factor  in the volcanic instability and transportation processes. This work sheds light on the transport and  emplacement mechanisms of debris avalanches based on a detailed granulometric and microtextural  analysis of the studied deposits. SM-DAD and T-DAD had a massive dynamic behavior during their emplacement, characterized by a lack of selective depositional process. The SM-DAD originated from a  “dry” inertial granular flow in which high-energy grain-grain interaction prevailed. Abundant fines and  fluids within the mass before the collapse could have enhanced its mobility. In fact, the water content in  the flowing mass promoted positive pore-water pressure that reduced the frictional energy dissipation  enhancing flow mobility. Both DADs show partially broken crystals/particles, percussion marks and fractures of different intensity that are the result of punctual, rapid and high-energy impacts. In general,  the observed microscopic features suggest that the particle-particle interaction occurred in a collisional  regime characterized by grains subjected to short, high velocity impacts, while evidence of frictional  interaction is less common than that of the collisional type.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/132/123
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Carbon and oxygen isotopic variations in early Albian limestone facies of the Mural Formation, Pitaycachi section, northeastern Sonora, Mexico","We used petrofacies analysis and stable isotope data to interpret the isotopic variations in the marine carbonate succession of the Early Cretaceous Mural Formation of northeastern Sonora (Pitaycachi  section), Mexico. The petrographic study reveals a range of lithofacies from bioclastic mudstones to boundstones. Allochems consist of corals, algae, rudists, echinoids, sponge spicules, radiolarians,  foraminifera and calpionellids. Samples analyzed for stable isotope are significantly depleted with δ18O  values of -15.19‰ to -6.32‰ and exhibit positive δ13C values ranging from 2.91‰ to 4.39‰. The lack  of correlation between δ13C and δ18O values also supports a primary marine origin for the δ13C values  of limestones from the Pitaycachi section. In the δ13C profile, the Cánova Member shows an upward  increasing trend from 3.09‰ to 4.36‰ interpreted to indicate an increase in the rate of marine organic  production and/or organic burial in the basin during early Albian time. The abrupt increase in carbon isotope values in the lower part of the section correlates with OAE1b. The shape of the C-isotope curve  of the present study is similar to other C-isotope curves from Mexico and other continents (e.g., Vacontian  basin, France) indicating that OAE1b may have been global in extent.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/133/124
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Mixed evaporite/carbonate characteristics of the Triassic  Kangan Formation, offshore area, Persian Gulf","The Early Triassic Kangan Formation is a mixed carbonate-evaporite succession that is considered  to be part of the largest carbonate gas reservoir in the Persian Gulf region. This stratigraphic succession is  characterized by alternating limestone, dolostone, evaporite and shale that have been investigated in terms  of evaporite facies characteristics in the Iranian offshore area. The main body of Kangan carbonates was  deposited in a shallow-marine, restricted carbonate ramp platform, and underwent intense near-surface  diagenesis and minor burial modification. Evaporitic facies consist of anhydrite, secondary anhydrite  after gypsum, and mixed carbonate-evaporite, which are dominant in the different parts of Kangan  Formation, as result of arid climate and abrupt eustatic sea level changes. This article focuses on the evaporite successions, in which diverse evaporitic lithofacies have been recognized that can be categorized  in two main classes: (1) carbonate-dominated facies with evaporite contents (C facies types), and (2)  evaporite-dominated with minor carbonate contents (A facies types). Fine-crystalline anhydrite laminae  and bands, bedded evaporite (bedded pseudomorphs); interstitial anhydrite pseudomorphs after gypsum  and nodular anhydrite are common features. The evaporite successions in microscopic and macroscopic  scales indicate that dolomitization and anhydrite precipitation took place contemporaneously, as ascribed  to sabkha/seepage-reflux models. The evaporite sedimentation has mainly occurred in a subsiding coastal basin of a salina or hypersaline lagoon. In this setting, the subaqueous precipitation of the carbonate  and evaporite lithofacies was followed by the interstitial growth of diagenetic, secondary anhydrite. As  a whole, the evaporite succession reflects an infilling and diagenetic process. Gypsum was converted to  anhydrite pseudomorphs following shallow to deep burial diagenesis events.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/134/125

This depozone contains the deposits between exhumed thrust-sheets (inner wedge top or piggy back basins  in this work) and the frontal part of the thrust wedge defined by the distal extent of hidden thrust systems  (outer wedge top). The outer wedge top is characterized by coarse, synorogenic sediments deposited  by piedmont systems in which numerous, progressive unconformities are found. The Corral Formation  (Pliocene) near Guandacol, Argentina, is an example for this type of deposit, related to a thin-skinned  thrust belt.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/135/126
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Inventario y caracterización morfoclimática de los glaciares de roca en la Cordillera Oriental argentina (entre 22o y 25o S),"This paper presents an inventory and a morphologic characterization of the rock glaciers in the arid  region of the Argentinean Cordillera Oriental (22-25o S), and discusses the climatic significance and the  factors controlling their distribution. We also present a detailed characterization of the Varas rock glacier,  which is located in the southern part of the Zenta range where dynamic and climatic monitoring has been initiated. A total of 635 rock glaciers were identified, including 174 (25%) classified as active, 301 (47.5%)  as inactive and 160 (25%) as fossil or relict. In general, the rock glaciers are small (<0.1 km2), with a  mean area of 0.076 km2. Rock glaciers distribution is associated with inherited Late Pleistocene glacial topography, which was also regulated by the regional climatic circulation system. The elevation of the lower limit of active rock glaciers is situated 416 m below the 0 °C isotherm, presenting positive mean  annual temperatures, as recognized in other regions of the Central Andes. Climatic changes occurred  after the Late Glacial period may have lead to the degradation and inactivation of rock glaciers. The  difference between the lower altitude of active (4500 m) and relict (3800 m) rock glaciers was used to  estimate a temperature rise of 4.9 °C in this region between deglatiation (after the Late Glacial period)  and the twentieth century (prior 1990). Although the area covered by glaciers in the Argentinean Cordillera Oriental is small (<0.8 km2), the identified rock glaciers represent an important water source  in this arid region.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/136/127
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geoquímica de tierras raras y fosfogénesis en un engolfamiento marino del Cretácico Tardío-Paleoceno de Patagonia, Provincia del Chubut, Argentina","Major and rare earth elements (REE) in authigenic phosphatic concretions of the siliciclastic Lefipán  Formation (Late Cretaceous – Paleocene of Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina) were analyzed. This geochemical study aimed to reveal the processes that led to the formation of the concretions under the  particular paleoenvironmental and diagenetic conditions in the sediments. Statistical principal component  analysis (PCA) was applied to the compositional data of the concretions. Two groups of elements with  high internal correlation were classified from the PCA analysis: a first group associated with the clastic  detritic components (SiO2, Al2O3 y TiO2), and a second group associated with the authigenic components (P2O5 y CaO). K and Mn plotted out of both groups. The abundance of K-rich authigenic glauconite and  the high mobility of Mn justify this geochemical behavior. REE abundances, normalized to Post-Archean  Australian Shale (PAAS) display slightly convex patterns, consistent with an estuarine coastal marine  environment, and also with early diagenetic processes linked to high concentrations of dissolved Fe  in pore water. The abundance of this metal in pore waters resulted in ferruginous cements and coated clasts in rocks of the Lefipán Formation, and was probably caused by intense chemical weathering on the  continent under humid, temperate to warm climate. Zoned concretions show higher REE content in the outer layer and a correlation between total REE content and medium REE enrichment are also observed.  This process is linked to post-depositional changes which led to incorporation and partition of REE from  circulating fluids during the early diagenesis. Fluctuation in the Ce anomaly reveals variable oxygenation  and salinity conditions. Minor changes in Y and La anomalies are the result of the early diagenesis.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/137/128
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Taxonomy and notes on the paleobiology of the late Pleistocene (Rancholabrean) antilocaprids (Mammalia, Artiodactyla, Antilocapridae) from the state of Hidalgo, central Mexico","A set of cranial and dental material of Antilocapridae was recovered from Quaternary deposits that  outcrop in southeastern Hidalgo, central Mexico. The fossil bearing unit consists of clay, silt, sand, and  scarce conglomeratic lenses in a fluvial environment; the specimens are associated with Bison indicating  a Rancholabrean Land Mammal Age. The comparative study of the material with selected specimens of North American antilocaprids, allowed its identification as the small-sized species Capromeryx minor  and the medium-sized Stockoceros conklingi. The sample referable to C. minor shows a combination  of cranial and dental characters typical of this species, including a large posterior tine that is curved  upward and forward, posterior horn core with a deep sulcus on its posterior side that extends from the  base to the tip, and well-developed heel on M3. The isotopic analysis of teeth referable to this species from Hidalgo indicates a mixed feeding dietary behavior. A partial skull and associated horn core fragments  were assigned to Stockoceros conklingi, considering its larger size than C. minor and shorter than the  extant pronghorn Antilocapra americana, as well as for having symmetrical and diverging horn cores,  and more outwardly flaring horn cores. The recognition of these antilocaprids in southeastern Hidalgo  represents one of the southernmost occurrences within temperate North America. The tiny Capromeryx  minor is known in North American localities of lower altitude (0–100 m a.s.l.) compared to those of the  medium-sized Stockoceros conklingi (1000–2000 m a.s.l.). Hence, body size differences between both  species and altitude differences between some of their localities suggests minimal direct competition  between these antilocaprids.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/138/129
