Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Paleomagnetism and isotopes of Hf in Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Guerrero Terrain, Chamela Bay and Cocinas Island (Jalisco, Mexico): tectonic implications","The southern extension of the Western Cordillera of North America, in western Mexico, is integrated by accreted terranes of oceanic affinity, conforming the Guerrero superterrane. This tectonic elements are composed of volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks from the Upper Jurassic to the Cretaceous, resting on a meta-sedimentary basement of supposed Triassic age of schists with tuffs and basalts with MORB chemistry. In the Zihuatanejo subterrane, the Tecalitlán Formation of the Lower Cretaceous is known to crop out in Chamela Bay and Cocinas Island (Jalisco); the Puerto Vallarta batholith to the north is inferred to intrude rocks of this formation. This unit is composed mainly of andesitic volcanic flows, epiclastic deposits from tuffs to breccias, and some sandstone intervals. From this sequence, 35 sites were collected for paleomagnetism, two samples for U-Pb geochronology and one for Hf analysis with the objective of establishing its paleogeographic relationship with the rest of Mexico, its absolute age, and the nature of the crust of the Jalisco block of the Zihuatanejo subterrane. The results obtained show that the volcanic rocks of the Tecalitlán Formation are andesites and dacites with a U-Pb age in zircons of 120 ± 1 Ma. The Hf isotopes in zircon present positive εHf initial values between +7.2 and +11.5, and Hf model ages TDM2Cbetween 442 and 714 Ma (average 557 Ma), indicating that there is no significant contamination by evolved continental crust, as observed in eastern Mexico (Oaxaquia). The natural remanent magnetization of these untis is multivectorial. Three paleomagnetic components were identified, where a dual polarity C component is interpreted as the characteristic one with mean of D = 341.0° and I = 39.8° (n = 25 sites, k = 15.1, α95= 7.7°) that indicates a northern paleolatitude of 21.8° ± 3.8°. Comparing the paleolatitude obtained in this study with the paleolatitudes expected for the Aptian, as calculated from reference poles of recent global compilations (28° to 26.2°), it is concluded that the western part of the Guerrero superterrane was close to its current latitudinal position with respect to the North American craton by 120 Ma. The Hf isotopes are consistent with models that interpret the Zihuatanejo subterrane as an intraoceanic arc, and not with models that suggest separation of a continental fragment from Oaxaquia by  opening of a back arc basin.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1048/1361

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Effects of the interaction between an acid solution and pedogenic carbonates: the case of the Buenavista del Cobre Mine, Mexico","The main purpose of this work was to study and understand the interaction that occurred between an acid solution spilled from Buenavista del Cobre Mine and the soils located in the Bacanuchi River area. The question put forward in this work was: if the soils of the area were able to cushion the impact of the acid solution?. Two soil profiles were examined: Profile 8A, was located on the riverbank and was affected by the spill, whilst Profile 8B, located on the first terrace of the river valley, remained intact . Both soils profiles were chemically characterized. An additional three surface samples (0-30 cm) were taken for geoavailability tests (RBI, SB2, belonging to Profile 8B, and SB3, belonging to Profile 8A). Two further samples, representing typical unaltered soils of profiles 8A and 8B, were taken for their micromorphological study. The results showed a difference between the two profiles, with profile 8A having more acidic pH, greater electrical conductivity, and higher concentrations of Fe, Pb, Cu and As than profile 8B. The geoavailability test showed that the elements enriched in SB3 were stable and not available to the aqueous phase. The soils of Bacanuchi River contain carbonates, which interacted with the acid solution and stabilized the potentially toxic elements presents in the spilled acid solution.  This interaction with carbonates promoted a new minerals formation such as gypsum and copiapite. So, the release of contaminants from soil to surface and ground waters is improbable, unless the redox conditions change or a new spill occurs releasing the potentially toxic elements (PTE) to the environment. In this work we show the importance of pedogenic carbonates in soils of arid and semi-arid environments; these carbonates represent a natural geochemical barrier, that can prevent the migration of PTEs in mining areas.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1039/1363
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"A new species of Sigmodontinae (Rodentia) from the late Hemphillian of central Mexico, and comments on the possible radiation of this group","The Sigmodontinae subfamily represents one of the most diverse groups of mammals in the world; this rodent group evolved in the open and arid ecosystems of the Miocene of North America and was the most successful legion of mammals in the Great American Biotic Interchange. Part of its diversification occurred in the Mexican Pliocene, in the Hemphillian-Blancan boundary, whereProsigmodonandSigmodonspecies are very common. Recent molecular phylogenetic systematics research propose thatSigmodonis related to South American sigmodontines, while studies of classical morphometry in isolated molar teeth considerProsigmodonas synonymy ofSigmodon, which modifies the biogeographic and chronostratigraphic interpretations of this group in America. In this paper, we describe a new species ofProsigmodonfrom the late Hemphillian (~4.89 Ma) of central Mexico based on jaws, maxillary, and complete isolated teeth. This is the most complete and austral record of the genus in North America. This species was compared with North American species of the Sigmodontinae and Neotominae subfamilies and we defined it as a newProsigmodonspecies characterized by having a consistently present minute mesoloph in M1 and M2, in addition, there is an isolated metaconid from the protoconid in the m1 of young individuals.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1162/1364

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Mode of crustal extension and formation of rift systems in the southern Gulf of California, from 2D seismic reflection data","In this paper, we carried out a kinematic analysis of the Cerralvo Extensional System (SEC), southern Gulf of California, and propose a crustal extension model from the processing and interpretation of 57.4 km of two-dimensional multichannel seismic-reflection data. The seismic image shows that in the SEC the main faults dip eastward with angles between 10–25° forming an asymmetric rift. The amount of horizontal extension measured in Cerralvo is 28.0 km, which corresponds to a crustal thinning factor of 2.0. The average subsidence rate in the SEC is 0.3 mm/yr, which is three times the marine sedimentation documented in this basin (0.1 mm/yr). Along the SEC, the acoustic basement is delimited by a layer with semi-continuous reflectors, which may represent cataclastic and/or mylonitic fabrics associated with low-angle normal faults. The penetrative deformation, the development of basins bounded by low-angle normal faults, as well as the magnitude of horizontal extension across the SEC, suggest simple shear deformation resulted in crustal extension since the late Miocene to the present. It is also inferred that the SEC is the eastern continuation of the Los Cabos Block structural system (BLC). Thus, our regional model proposes that in the currently advanced phase of the continental rupture process and the opening of the GC, the BLC and SEC fault systems converge at depth forming a regional detachment surface along the upper crust, causing the hanging wall to rotate to lower dip angles forming asymmetric basins with an eastward tectonic transport.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1352/1366
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Shortening estimation in chevron with post flexion deformation,"Folds are geological structures present in many tectonic environments, their geometry allows us to obtain a quantitative approximation of the deformation that they accommodated. Chevron folds are an important tool to estimate shortening in orogenic systems, due to their particular geometry. In spite of this, a method to calculate the amount of shortening (dynamic and kinematic) consistent with the theory of chevron folds has not been proposed. In this work, we propose a new method for the calculation of total shortening in chevron folds that have a post-buckling deformation based on the theoretical considerations of Ramsay (1974). Our method is conceptually simple and general, so that it can be applied to estimate the amount of shortening in the orogenic systems around the world.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1493/1367
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Reconnaissance geology and geophysics of the Mercurio structural dome, Chihuahua, Mexico","The Mercurio structural dome is a poorly exposed and complex structure located in the transitional region between the Coahuila Calcareous Platform and the San Pedro El Gallo sector of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Mexico. It is located in the State of Chihuahua, close to the limits with Coahuila and Durango, Mexico. The dome is a circular structure, ~16 km in diameter, that can be seen in air-photos, satellite images, and shaded relief maps, but that has a subtle topographic expression on the ground. As seen in the field, the most conspicuous topographic features in the area are several hills with the morphology of volcanic necks that rise up to 250 m above the surrounding terrain. The deformation fringe of the dome is a series of cuesta-like low hills, less than 30 m high, where a poorly lithified volcano-sedimentary succession (litharenites, polymictic conglomerates, and ignimbrites) is almost completely masked by desert pavement, which is mainly constituted by well-rounded calcareous clasts derived from the Mesozoic sedimentary marine rocks and by less abundant Paleogene volcanic rocks exposed in the region. Inside the dome the following units are exposed: 1) the pre-volcanic basement in a NW-trending, upright, open anticline developed in limestone of the Aurora Formation, 2) a series of hills where is exposed a succession of epiclastic and volcanic rocks, which are similar, in age and lithology, to some facies of the Ahuichila Formation, and 3) a NW-trending dike, exposed at Cerro Dinamita, which is interpreted as an offshoot of the buried subvolcanic body that created the dome. The deformation fringe around the buried intrusive has a quaquaversal array in the bedding and forms a simple monocline-like structure in the NE part of the dome. A set of SE- and NW-trending plunging folds forms the SE and SW portions of the dome, respectively. The NW part of the fringe is nearly completely masked by volcanic rocks, but there is a ~W plunging syncline in the area.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1340/1369
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Paleopedogenesis, sedimentation and holocenic geomorphologic evolution in the fluvial system of Arroyo Tinajas, Sonora","In this work an integral analysis of a pedo-sedimentary sequence is presented, found in the lower fluvial terrace of the arroyo Tinajas, Sonora. The objective of this research is to establish the mechanism of the sequence formation in order to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions. The sequence consists on a modern soil and eleven paleosols interbedded with fluvial sediments. The physical (color, grain size distribution, rock magnetic properties), chemical (pH, electric conductivity, total calcium content), and micromorphological properties are evaluated. The clay mineralogy determined by X-ray diffraction is also presented. Practically all the paleosols are truncated. Due to the lack of A horizons, the chronological frame of the sequence was obtained by using a small amount of organic matter found in the paleosol 8. To concentrate the organic matter, an extraction by demineralization with hydrofluric acid was used. This concentrated organic matter is dated by14C accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), giving an age of 8415 ± 90 years cal BP. The results show that all paleosols are weakly developed. However, it is possible to establish the main pedogenetic tendencies: the lower part of the sequence is finer, with strong reductomorphic features and vertic properties. In contrast, the upper paleosols are coarser in texture, more porous and have clay coatings. From paleosol 7, a change in the relief energy is detected due to the sedimentological variations (inverse gradation, increase in grain size), which is more evident in the paleosols 2, 3, 4, due to the high amount of gravels, bad sorting and angular shapes, related to fluvio-colluvial processes. We suppose that this change in the pedogenetic trend and the sedimentological variations is related to regional climatic oscillations in the middle Holocene, because no recent tectonic activity has been documented in the area.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1331/1371
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Age and origin of the continental Teocaltiche paleo-basin, Mexico","An extensive lake existed during part of the Oligocene and almost all the Miocene in the region located east of the southern end of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOc). The lake was formed in a tectonic depression associated with the Aguascalientes graben and the Teocaltiche half-graben. Sediments accumulated inside this continental basin are epiclastic, mainly derived from volcanic rocks of the SMOc, and from the volcanic cover of the Mesa Central, chemical and biochemical precipitates (fresh water limestone), and mixed sediments, as well as far less voluminous, but ubiquitous, volcanic ash-fall layers, which were used to obtain U-Pb ages from zircons. The age range of the basin-fill sediments is broad, varying from Rupelian (~28.6 Ma) to Tortonian (~7.6 Ma). Previously, on the basis of fossil fauna, the succession was considered only as late Miocene in age.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1391/1372

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Unblocking temperature of secondary magnetic component to outline anomaly thermomagnetic maps of archaeological fireplaces from the southern region of  Mexico City, Mexico",We report a magnetic study of two preceramic hearths located at the southern region of Mexico City. Thermal demagnetization was applied between 200 to 540 °C to define the remanent magnetization components. The maximum unblocking temperature of the secondary magnetic component reached due to the last heating was identified in most samples. They were used to develop thermomagnetic anomaly source maps. The direction of this component was used to place the blocks to their last cooling spot and configurate a real and primal magnetic anomaly map produced by the thermoremanent magnetization acquired. A protocol to relocate blocks frame is proposed using geomagnetic secular variation curves. The thermomagnetic mapping revealed the position and temperature (220 to 460 °C) of the last heat sources. The distribution of these sources allowed to model an extensional zone of benefit and probable uses of the hearths.,,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1528/1374
