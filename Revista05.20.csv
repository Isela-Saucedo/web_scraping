This work compares the predictions using two different models for an activated sludge biofilm attached to a permeable membrane reactor. The first model considers the biofilm like a one-phase effective solid media where diffusion and reaction takes place, in contact with an external liquid phase where the substrates are transfered to the biofilm through the interphase. The second model considers an external liquid phase in contact with a two-phase porous biofilm, formed by a network of clusters made of extracellular polymer substances (EPS) containing the cells, interconnected by pores and channels containing liquid; here the substrates contained in pores and channels are transported by convection and diffusion and are supplied to the EPS network to fuel the bioreaction, which occurs only within the EPS structure; the role of external liquid phase is the same as in the first model. The first (pseudo-homogeneous) model is similar to models published already in the literature, whereas the second (pseudo-heterogeneous) one is a new model and has been used to successfully describe (qualitatively) the experimental observations of dissolved oxygen profiles measured inside a biofilm by Lewandowski y col. (1995).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1888/975

ISOLATED OF SHRIMP WASTE,"Nine strains were isolated from a shrimp waste in Cartagena Colombia. Different morphological groups were identifying: Gram-positive coccus, Gram-positive bacillus and actinomycetes. The strain 9A identified as Streptomyces sp was the best strain reaching significantly quantities (p<0.05) of sugars reducers associated with quitinolytic activity (0.035 U l-1) in a medium with colloidal chitin to alkaline pH (9.2) and high concentrations of NaCl (6% p/v). This microorganism could be alkalophilic and moderately halophilic bacteria. By means of an experimental design 22 were demonstrated that the interaction of the two chitin types (colloidal chitin and waste shrimp) in their higher concentrations increased significantly (p<0.05) the enzymativ activity 0.120 U l-1 after 16 days of evaluation. Using the modified medium was carried out the final kinetics to Erlenmeyer flasks scale finding a positive correlation between cellular viability and enzymatic activity (p<0.05), demonstrating that these substrates were used as carbon source and they acted as inducer of the enzymatic activity 0.156 U l-1 after 26 day of growth. Finally Streptomyces sp was able to degrade waste shrimp to 1% p/v in a water suspension at pH 9.2 stabilized with NaCl to 1% p/v under minimum nutritional conditions after 8 days the treatment.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1889/976

ROASTED IN FLUIDIZED BED,"In this work, the hydrodynamics of fluidization of green and roasted coffee beans was studied at three different levels of temperature, processing time and superficial air velocity Uo. Also, the effect of these variables on color, weight loss, moisture content, bulk density, increase in volume and equivalent diameter of the coffee bean were studied. Green coffee beans Typical var. was applied as testing material. A factorial design 23was used, adding a central point to determine the effect of independent variables on hydrodynamics parameters. Low level, central point and high levels values were 220, 230 and 240oC for air temperature; 5, 7.5 and 10 minutes for processing times and 3, 3.5 and 4 m/s for Uo. Results showed that temperature and processing time had a significant effect (p<0.05) on color of the bean, loss of weight, moisture content, bulk density and increase in volume of grain. Time-temperature and time-air velocity combination also had significant effect on loss of weight and on the increase of grain volume.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1897/982

Such phenomena become evident in relatively short periods of time, making nopal a highly perishable product. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chitosan addition during blanching on the preservation of nopal quality. Duration of blanching and chitosan concentration were evaluated. Changes in pH, titratable acidity (%), total soluble solids (°Brix), color (L*, a*, b*), mucilage drainage volume and PPO and POD enzymatic activity were determined. It was observed that the most affected variables by the treatments (p ≤ 0.05) were (color) greenness (a* value) and mucilage drainage volume. Loss of color was observed in all treatments; but in the case samples with no chitosan addition, the extent of greenness loss was 50% with respect to the raw material, while the use of chitosan reduced the color loss to only 16%. Mucilage drainage volume was reduced up to 57 % by chitosan addition. Also, the PPO enzymatic activity was completely reduced while the POD was reduced up to 3 % with chitosan utilization.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1898/983

Yogurts consisted of a 100 % sucrose control and 3 formulations with 25, 37.5, and 50 % of the sucrose substituted by neotame. Sweetness of all treatments was evaluated using timeintensity (TI) techniques. Yogurts with 37.5 and 50 % sucrose substituted by neotame were perceived as sweeter and of longer sweetness duration. The sweetness profile of 25 % sucrose substituted by neotame yogurt was comparable to that of the sucrose sweetened control. During TI evaluations, differences in metallic aftertaste were identified, however, 3-AFC tests (n = 36) showed similar d’ values for all yogurts. Consumers (n = 100) did not express preference for any of the yogurts. All treatments presented a similar behavior for pH, water activity, consistency, and titratable acidity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1899/984

The catalysts were prepared by deposition precipitation method, and characterized by electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM) to obtain the average particle size and the morphology of metal particles, and by EDS to evaluate metal loading on the support. Results show that gold and silver nanoparticles highly dispersed on the TiO2 surface are active in ODS of organosulfur compounds. The catalytic performance of gold and silver nanoparticles was different. For silver catalysts, it is propose that the better-crystallized particles are more active when the temperature of thermal treatment is increased and sulfone production is improved. For gold catalysts, the sulfone production is improved at low temperature of thermal treatment.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1890/977

The flow fields considered are slow viscous flow or Stokes flow and straining motion or shear flow around the particle. The parabolic differential equations were discretised with finite difference method in space, and the resulting set of ordinary differential equations on time was solved by the method of lines. The analysis includes the radial convective term generated due to the density differences between the solid and liquid phases. The effect due to the natural convection caused by density differences between both phases are evaluated and compared with the effect due to the low Reynolds convective flow field. The numerical solution for the isothermal dissolution of a spherical particle in a binary melt is not only compared with integral method for small times of the process but also the results are verified with mass balance integration. The integral method solutions are found to agree with the numerical results for small time of dissolution.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1891/978

In addition, the incorporation of the metallic pair, which was carried out while the doped silica was synthesized with iron, was evaluated; copper, manganese and nickel were utilized. From the solids obtained the most effective absorbent, is the doped silica with iron, with a 57% m/m of total retained As, followed by the solid pair iron-copper with a 33% m/m of total retained As. These solids showed the best capacities of effective retention (CRE) for arsenate ions, with values of 148.169 and 105.310 mg As Kg−1, respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1892/979

The average water use for Exterior-only wash was 50 L per small-size car and 170 L per medium-size vehicle (pick up, van or light truck). The Full-service wash (exterior, engine and chassis) required 170 L per small-size car and 300 L per light truck. Wastewaters were generally emulsified and contained high contaminant loads (in average, 1100 mg/L oil and grease, 4500 mg/L COD and 3500 mg/L Total Suspended Solids). Gravity oil separators used in the car washing facilities were able to reduce the pollutant loads (showing a 80 % efficiency) but usually not enough to meet the sewer discharge standards or reuse requirements. The data provided by the study are useful for screening the applicable technologies and setting the design capacity of the reclaim systems that are needed in the Mexican car washing sector.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1893/980

The cell contains two closely-facing parallel circular disk electrodes [radius R2, separation distance 2a]. The electrolyte enters the cell through a central circular hole [radius R1] in one disk and flows radially between the disks in the laminar flow regime. Specifically, the work deals with the effect of the scale on stationary liquid-to-disk mass transport. Three cells were used, allowing a maximum scale factor of 12.5. Dimensional analysis of the mass transport problem yields the five dimensionless numbers R2/R1, 2a/(R2-R1), Re, Sh and Sc, to be correlated as:",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1900/985

The crucial step to polymerize the commercial PDMSMA macromonomers was their purification using a free radical pre-polymerization technique. The separation of homopolymer and unreacted PDMS-MA macromonomer was achieved by precipitation in a mixture of diethyl ether/methanol (1:1). Kinetic studies of homopolymerization yielded the ratio between rate of propagation and termination (kp/kt ½). This ratio decreased with increasing the molecular weight of the macromonomers. The apparent rate of propagation was proportional to [I]2.2 and [M] for appropriate polymerizations conditions. The ceiling temperature were calculated for macromonomers with Mn = 1 and 5 Kg/mol, to be Tc= 160°C at [M1]= 0.88 and [M5]= 0.11 mol/L, for both homopolymers.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1901/986

One obtains the control transfer function of a class of each control input in a parallel control architecture. That is, every controller is driven by the same output regulation error. The parallel control scheme aimed to improve the disturbance rejection capabilities of the controlled process. A secondary variable is used in the above scheme mentioned to effectively reject disturbance to the biological system. In this way, the use of the recycle dilution rate as a secondary control input is in order to distribute the control effort. Simulation results are used to illustrate the control design methodology and the performance of the resulting controllers.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1902/987
