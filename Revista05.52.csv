Efficient conversion of fermentable sugars by yeast into bioethanol from lingo-cellulosic biomass is one of the most important attribute. In order to get temperature and ethanol tolerant yeast strain, one hundred and seventy one soil samples were collected from adjacent areas of various sugar mills located in Punjab, Pakistan. Fifty six yeast strains were isolated and primarily screened for bioethanol production. Maximum bioethanol producing (3.07 g/L) yeast strain IHZ-26 was identified by sequencing of 18S rRNA ITS region and identified as a new strain ofWickerhamomyces anomaluswhich was assigned GenBank accession numberKT883963. This strain demonstrated substantial tolerance to ethanol (25%) and temperature (50°C) and have the ability to significantly ferment several sugars i.e. glucose, fructose, mannose, maltose, xylose and lactose. To the best of our knowledge, this is first report of multi stress tolerantWickerhamomyces anomalusfrom Pakistan. This yeast with these distinct characteristics can be employed in bioethanol industry for more viable and economical process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/269/162

Steam explosion is used as pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to increase the accessibility of sugars. An approach based on sustainability and development of biorefineries allows proposing the integrated use of agave bagasse pretreatment fractions to produce bio-hydrogen. In this work, hydrolysates from steam-explosion pretreated agave bagasse were used as substrate in microbial electrolysis cells (MEC). Hydrolysates were evaluated at concentrations of 20 %, 40 % and 100 % (v/v). Besides, the use of hydrolysates was compared by analyzing two inoculum sources, compost leachate and granular sludge. The highest hydrogen production was 8.5 mL L-1d-1, which was achieved using 20 % hydrolysate, 10 % compost leachate at the anodic potential of 0.8 V/Ag/AgCl in a two-chamber microbial electrolysis cell.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/298/175

Espadin and generates large quantities of bagasse and vinasses that contaminate the environment. This paper presents a study on the co-digestion ofAgave angustifoliaHaw bagasse and vinasses for biogas production under minimal operation requirements (water and nutrients), typical in mezcal production facilities. Methane production results fromAgave angustifoliaHaw bagasse (AAHB) are compared toAgave tequilanaWeber bagasse var. Azul (ATWB) from the Tequila industry at the same tested conditions. Small fibers of AAHB are more effective for producing methane than large fibers but adding high concentrations of vinasses stops the generation of methane. The resistance of fiber to biodegradation by microorganisms is partly observed in AAHB but not in ATWB. The type of inoculum had a strong effect on the methane yield. ATWB plus granular sludge gave rise to a potential methane production 65% more than AAHB plus granular sludge.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/352/177

In the nitrifying SBR, it was possible to remove ammonium (150 mg N/L) by nitrification, mineralize the mixtures of phenolic compounds (up to 120 mg C/L), and oxidize sulfide (15 mg S/L) to sulfate. The addition of mixed phenolic compounds and sulfide into the reactor provoked a decrease in specific rates of the nitrifying processes, however, the use of SBR system allowed a decrease of the inhibitory effects along the cycles. The sludge showed a metabolic adaptation to consume the mixtures of phenolic compounds and sulfide throughout the cycles with increasing specific rates of removal. The obtained results showed that the nitrifying SBR can be used for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with ammonium, mixtures of phenolic compounds, and sulfide.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/411/197

Nevertheless, available methods for assay haloalkaliphilic proteases on protein substrates are few, are carry out to end point and implies the use of complicated steps. A new high throughput screening assay is described involving pH indicators at haloalkaline conditions. Rapid Enzymatic Determination method use casein as natural substrate and salts: NaCl and KCl to measure the activity of halophilic proteases. When a peptide bond is cleaved by a protease a proton is released changing the color of the indicator, proteolysis is followed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance.

Additionally, we determined the effect of pre-oxidation with NaOCl on the simultaneous removal of MA, MC-LR, and DOM, using the same processes and conditions. The water used in experimental tests was prepared with distilled water, strains of MA, microcystin-LR standards, and model compounds of DOM. Once the water was prepared, the proves were carried out in jar test equipment. We used a fractional factorial design to obtain the variables of significant influence and a response surface design to attain the optimal operation conditions of each process. The DOM removal decreased 32.25% when MA and MC-LR were in the process because they were competitors for the coagulant, but the main effect was caused by MA due its high concentration and physicochemical characteristics.

Significant differences occurred in the juice volume of fruits during all three seasons evaluated; however, no differences were detected in their weight, size, shape, rind thickness, or flavedo color (L*, C*, h). TSS/TA (total soluble solids/titratable acidity) ratios were high (10.3-12.9) in fruits collected during spring and summer. Overall, the oranges met the specifications of both national and international quality standards. Changes during storage indicated that compression force, % weight loss, and sensorial flavor were negatively impacted by storage at 24⁰C while TSS and TA of juice remained unaffected at 11 and 24 ⁰C. The commercial life of oranges was 21 d at 24 ⁰C and > 28 d at 11 ⁰C as determined from changes in the concentrations of certain aroma compounds and from differences in the firmness of their rinds.

The use of vegetable oils as alternative solvents to extract biocompounds is considered a green process. Although avocado leaves are underexploited they are still rich in naturally-occuring biocompounds. Therefore, we propose the use of edible vegetable oils as green solvents to extract biocompounds from avocado leaves and preserve them by means of spray-drying microencapsulation. Spray drying allowed an encapsulation efficiency of 50% of the avocado leaves pigments extracted with edible oils. The emulsions prepared were heterogeneous and with low cohesiveness which was observed through de polidispersity index (0.52 - 0.87) and the Z-potential (-35.9 to -38.0) respectively. Microcapsules Haussner ratio values (1.49 – 1.61) showed the cohesiveness of the powders, this was confirmed by microscopy techniques, obtaining high particles area values (177.4 – 4460.5 µm2). Corn oil extracts showed higher carotenoids (>10%), chlorophyll a (approximately 5%) and chlorophyll b (>40%) content as compared with safflower oil extracts. However, the higher hygroscopicity values of the corn oil microcapsules (15.70 – 18.34 g water/ 100 g dry capsules) caused changes in their appearance turning its color from white to pale yellow.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/407/219

The model presented here consider cell degradation in a tubular reactor. To test and validate this model, a prototype was built and tested. The simulation of fluid dynamics and concentration gradients was carried out in a one-dimensional system using finite elements, and, according to the results of these simulations, the production of biogas in the tubular reactor was divided into different strata. This may be due to the diffusion of the substrate through the reactor, which causes different growth rates for microorganisms which depend on the availability of the substrate. Theoretical and experimental results showed good agreement with each other. The results obtained in this work can aid in the development of a compact, simple and efficient system capable of producing biogas on a small scale and with continuous production whose use is feasible in small communities.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/260/160

The multiple reference frame approach is employed to model the impeller rotation. The work focuses specifically on investigating the influence of the surface position separating the rotating reference frame (RRF) and the static reference frame (SRF) regions over the numerical results reliability. Power number measurements were obtained to validate the CFD model. It was found that for laminar flow, the interface position between both regions does not have a substantial effect on numerical results. However, its position plays a substantial role as the flow regime increases; the higher this is, the larger the RRF must be. Finally, we employ the RRF-region dimensions obtained in turbulent conditions for reproducing satisfactorily experimental results of a published system.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/594/187

Nanocatalyst propagates into the porous medium and promotes exothermic reactions that provide additional heating to the reservoir. The objective of this work is to capture the main thermal processes involved in nanocatalytic in-situ upgrading by presenting a simple analytical model. This model considers the transient temperature distribution within a matrix block heated by a constant temperature and heat flux. To achieve this goal, the formulation of various stages including heating up, hydroprocessing heating, and post-hydroprocessing heating were carried out based on energy balance equation, various boundary conditions and using a  semi-analytical method known as Heat Integral Method (HIM) to solve the equation.

The treatments allowed for the reduction of the initial concentrations of DDX (30 mg/kg), endrin (150 mg/kg), and endosulfan (40 mg/kg) at both scales, indicating their suitability. However, in the case of DDX-polluted soil, the accumulation of the intermediate compound DDNS was registered. In microcosms experiments, the highest degradation percentage for DDX was obtained using a Fe0/Cu0ratio of 10/3 (w/w). The degradation observed in the bench-scale reactor was improved for endrin and endosulfan-polluted soils, while degradation of DDX was similar to that found in microcosms experiments. The Fe0/Cu0system mainly improves the degradation rates of DDD, DDE, and endrin, reducing the time of treatment from 8 to 4 days. The selection of the remediation strategies using Fe0/Cu0or Fe0should weigh the cost of copper versus the time of treatment since the extent of remediation was similar for most experiments, except for DDD and DDE.

In order to improve the original design, the effect of the windows configurations and the inlet volumetric flow was investigated. For the configurations performance assessment, the local velocity gradient and residence time distribution were calculated. The simulation results indicate that the window position have a considerable effect on the velocity gradient and retention time distribution, while the number of windows showed a negligible effect on the retention time. It was possible to decrease the local gradient mean error between $10$ and $20 \%$ by employing $2$ windows instead of $1$.

The microbial production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is a very promising way for valorizing glycerol.ClostridiumdiolisDSM 15410 converts glycerol into 1,3-PD and is of industrial value due to its high fermentation yields and productivities. The aim of this study was to design a biotechnological process for the continuous production of 1,3-PD (> 99.0% purity) from crude glycerol usingC. diolisDSM 15410 as biological system, and evaluate the process economic profitability under different scenarios. Optimal fermentation parameters were considered for the analysis.

Volumetric power input (P/V) is normally used to scale-up bioprocesses. Here, we analyzed the effect of P/V onS. lividansgrowth and morphology as well as the production andO-mannosylation of the recombinant glycoprotein APA fromMycobacterium tuberculosis. Previously, we measured the P/V in conventional normal (NF, 0.20 kW/m3) and coiled (CF, 0.44 kW/m3) shake flasks. Here, these P/V were matched in 1.0 L bioreactors by adjusting the stirring speed. Similar specific growth rates were observed between shake flask and bioreactor cultures. In addition, similar rAPA yields (~25%) were observed in both the bioreactor and NF cultures, but these were lower than the yield in the CF culture (~36%). Furthermore, up to seven mannose residues were attached to the C-terminal of rAPA in both bioreactor cultures, which was one more than in the NF and CF cultures. However, at similar P/V, the morphology and biomass kinetics of growth were not similar. Our data indicate that scaling-up the production of recombinant glycoproteins usingS. lividansby matching the P/V can be successful in terms of some, but not all stequeometric parameters, suggesting that the cellular responses could be differently affected by hydrodynamics/aeration differences between shake flasks and bioreactors.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/363/182

The electrical conductivity of the materials was determined by measuring the resistivity using the four point probe method. The results show that different growth mechanisms of the species are generated in the different Bi2Se3/BiOCl composites, modifying the synthesis conditions.

The calculated average PR was 86.8% for the 36 months, even though,it had a lower PR of about 84.8 % in the last 12 months due to the PV array string outages and also inverter technical troubles.  The average daily energy produced by the PV system in 3 years was 260.45 kWh/day and anaverage accumulated energy of 95,064.25 kWh per year.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/302/206
