Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Feeding ecology and habitat of Late Pleistocene Equus horses from west-central Mexico using carbon and oxygen isotopes variation,"Using carbon and oxygen stable isotopes we analyzed the diet and habitat of three Late Pleistocene horses (Equus mexicanus,E. conversidens, andE. cedralensis) from two localities in west-central Mexico. Our objective was to evaluate dietary adaptability and resource partitioning, which would reflect the environmental conditions of the localities on which horses fed, and would support the ecological scenario predicted from morphology and ecomorphology. Our preliminary results show the presence of two feeding styles in La Cinta-Portalitos, indicating some resource partition and a more diverse environment: one ofE. mexicanuswith a diet composed by C3/C4 plants, and another one ofE. conversidensandE. cedralensiswith high consumption of C4 plants. Contrastingly, in La Piedad-Santa Ana only one feeding group was present, in which the three horse species fed mainly on C4 plants, thus possibly demonstrating the absence of resource partitioning and the abundance of a single food plant resource for horses. The major dietary variation we recorded was inE. mexicanus, followed by that inE. cedralensisandE. conversidens, which evidences that in the past, horses exhibited a more diverse diet related both to an eclectic behavior and to the varied environmental conditions in which they lived. We also found that the ecological predictions (habitat) based on ecomorphological characteristics were supported for some populations, but not for others; this indicates a complex relation between body mass, limb proportions and diet, more research being needed for better understanding of this relation. Finally, our results suggest a highly heterogeneous habitat with a mixture of C3 and C4 plants in La Cinta-Portalitos, and a more open scenario with a higher diversity of C4 plants and presence of woody vegetation of C3 plants in La Piedad-Santa Ana.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/493/391
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,New age constraints on magmatism and metamorphism of the Western Sonobari Complex and their implications for an earliest Late Cretaceous orogeny on northwestern Mexico,"The Western Sonobari Complex in northwestern Mexico is composed of orogenic metamorphic rocks intruded by a variety of unmetamorphosed plutons and dikes. Petrologic studies and U-Pb geochronology allow dividing the protolith of orthogneisses in the next groups: a) Lower Triassic granodiorite and quartz monzodiorite (249.6–241.3 Ma); b) Upper Triassic granodiorite (213.7–203.5 Ma); c) Upper Jurassic tonalite and granodiorite (162.9–159.1 Ma); and d) Lower Cretaceous diorite (99.9–98.8 Ma). Most of these rocks display amphibolite facies metamorphism, pervasive foliation and several stages of folding. Recrystallized zircon rims yield U-Pb ages of 92.3±4.1 and 90.1±1.3 Ma, which are interpreted to date the orogenic metamorphism. Metamorphic rocks are intruded by numerous post-orogenic granitic dikes dated at 83.9±0.5 to 80.6±1.7 Ma. Geochronology of igneous rocks indicates that the Cordilleran magmatic belts including Triassic and Jurassic plutons continue through northwestern-central Mexico apparently without displacement by the Mojave-Sonora megashear. Correlation based on the age, lithology of protoliths and metamorphic imprint suggests that the earliest Late Cretaceous orogen extends at least from southern California up to Nayarit in west-central Mexico. On the basis of its age and contractional character, the orogenic metamorphism event is related to the collision of the Alisitos arc against the western margin of Pangea but occurring inland the continent not at the contact between these blocks.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/494/393
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Trophic State Index estimation from remote sensing of lake Chapala, México","The Trophic State Index (TSI) was estimated for Lake Chapala by remote sensing techniques as an indicator of water quality. Our results show that multispectral satellite images can be successfully used to monitor surface water parameters related to trophic state (i.e., chlorophyll-a and Secchi disc depth). Lake Chapala is the largest water body in Mexico and supplies Guadalajara City with over 60% of its freshwater requirements. The Lerma River is the main tributary of Lake Chapala and exhibits significant water quality deterioration associated with nutrient enrichment coming from drainage from urban, agriculture and livestock areas. This study is based on the modification of the optical properties of the water caused by increased values of turbidity and Chl-a. We estimated turbidity on the basis of empirical relationships between reflectance data in band SPOT S2 and Secchi disc depth, and Chl-a concentration values from the relationship between band ratio SPOT S3/S2 and Chl-a concentration in the water samples. The results show that application of defoliants to eradicate aquatic weeds did not ameliorate the trophic state of the lake. The Trophic State Index determinations are based on multispectral image reflectance values, which revealed Chapala to be in the range from oligotrophic to mesotrophic. The use of remote sensing data allows a more efficient, continuous and low-cost Trophic State Index monitoring of Lake Chapala to assist in the implementation of regulations toward water quality improvement.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/495/395
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Early Pliocene tracer of North Atlantic and South Pacific sea surface currents: Janthina typica (Bronn, 1860) (Mollusca: Gastropoda)","Janthina typicais an extinct, rare, floating species of gastropod from the early Pliocene whose fossils have an unusual geographic distribution, appearing in the eastern North Atlantic archipelagos (Canary, Azores, Madeira and Selvagen Islands), Morocco, and Pacific (New Zealand, Australia and Japan). This study examines the origin of this biogeography and how the species may have dispersed via sea surface currents. We have considered the published ecological aspects of the genusJanthina, theJanthina typicafossil localities, and ocean palaeocurrents. Abundant specimens ofJ. typicaare found in marine deposits on Gran Canaria island (northeast Atlantic), 40Ar/39Ar dated at 4.2 Ma. These deposits therefore accumulated just before the end of the early Pliocene warm climate and closely predate the start of global changes that gave rise to the world’s present climate. In the early Pliocene, the cold Canary Current did not yet exist. The subtropical northeastern Atlantic Ocean was warmer than today and its waters would have met the Circumtropical Current that crossed the Central American Seaway from the Caribbean to the Pacific. From there, the South Equatorial Current flowed towards the eastern coast of Indonesia before splitting north towards Japan and south as the East Australian Current. The latter must also have extended along the southern coast of Australia, crossing the Bass Strait before reaching the area of modern-day Perth in southwestern Australia. The reverse journey (from Australia to the eastern Atlantic Ocean) would have posed far more obstacles, and is considered improbable.J. typicatherefore likely originated in the East Atlantic. The main causes for its extraordinary geographic distribution are its ecology as a floating animal in warm water, tectonic plate movements that permitted an open Central American Seaway and a restricted Indonesian Seaway, and Earth’s rotation and its influence on marine currents.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/496/396
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Interpretation of the geophysical well log from the San Lorenzo Tezonco well and its lithological correlation in the Mexico basin,"We describe the results obtained from the analysis of the geophysical well log conducted at the San Lorenzo Tezonco (SLT) well, which is located in the eastern part of Mexico City and has 2,008 m in depth. The geophysical well log was conducted in three stages and consisted of temperature, electrical resistivity, natural potential and gamma radiation, although the gamma radiation and natural potential logs malfunctioned during the last stage. The analysis presented here is based mainly on the electrical resistivity and gamma logs; the interpretation is based on channel (cutting) samples and petrologic and stratigraphic descriptions of the SLT well previously published. By analyzing the well log data and correlating them with the lithology reported for nearby shallow wells it was possible to complete the stratigraphy between 120 m and 500 m, which was absent in previous reports due to the lack of channel cuttings. The results show that the geologic materials in the SLT well are considerably more heterogeneous and have differing thicknesses than those previously reported. Among the zones of hydrogeological interest, an aquitard of volcanic origin, with relatively low clay content, is inferred between 750 and 880 m depth from the well log. In addition, the analysis allowed identifying potential water-productive strata. For future exploratory deep wells in the Basin of Mexico, it is suggested to include additional geophysical logs (density and sonic) and to obtain cores, which would allow a quantitative interpretation of petrophysical properties of the subsurface.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/497/397
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Magnetic dating of Holocene volcanic rocks: case of the lava flows around Pátzcuaro Lake (Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field),"Archaeomagnetic dating is based on the fact that baked clays often contain small amounts of magnetic minerals that under certain conditions, can record the direction and intensity of the Earth magnetic field in the past. When the reference secular variation (SV) curve is well established for a given geographical area, the archaeomagnetic analyzes provide an accurate dating of the last heating of the studied artifacts. In this paper we apply this dating method to recent lava flows formed during the past 14,000 years using the geomagnetic field prediction model SHADIF14K. The full vector (declination, inclination and absolute geomagnetic intensity) values are satisfactorily compared with previous dating using radiometric methods (14C) for 3 out of 4 analyzed lavas around Patzcuaro Lake and belonging to the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field. A single lava flow shows a reverse magnetic polarity and was probably formed during the short geomagnetic event Lashamp between 40 and 45 ka.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/498/398
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Stratigraphic revision and structure of Sierra Plomosa, Chihuahua","New geological mapping and U-Pb dating of detrital zircons and volcanic rocks permit stratigraphic revision and interpretation of pre- Late Permian deformation in the Sierra Plomosa area, located 95 km east of the city of Chihuahua and at comparable distance to the southwest of the border town Ojinaga. The Plomosas area forms the central part of a north-northwest trending uplifted block ranging from Placer de Guadalupe at the north, to the cerro Carrizalillo at the south. Along this elevated block, Precambrian crystalline basement rocks are exposed, as well as lower Paleozoic rocks belonging to the southern platform of Laurentia and upper Paleozoic to lower Mesozoic clastic and volcaniclastic rocks. The main structures in the area are north-northwest trending folds and thrust faults showing a west-southwest vergence or tectonic transport, being the age of this deformation, necessarily pre-Late Permian, given the occurrence of an erosional and angular unconformity between strongly deformed pre-Permian strata and less deformed Permian-Triassic clastic and volcaniclastic deposits which contain Archean (3,022–2,513Ma), Paleoproterozoic (2,461–1,601Ma), Mesoproterozoic (1,592–1,013Ma), Neoproterozoic (994–546Ma) and Paleozoic (533–252Ma) detrital zircon populations, with maximum depositional ages calculated between 252 and 244 Ma and isolated concordant zircons as young as 227 to 223 Ma. In the middle part of the permo-triasic succession, a Permian rhyolitic flow or ignimbrite was previously reported on the basis of a lead alpha age, however, during the present research this rock yielded an Early Jurassic age of 183.3+2.2/–2.7 Ma. On the basis of petrographic features and field relations, the rhyolite is interpreted as an ash flow tuff or ignimbrite, similar to other rhyolitic flows observed in the area. Such flows are concordant to bedding and several clasts of this rock are present in strata overlying the rhyolite. All Paleozoic rocks, including the top of the Permian and Lower Triassic, underlie clastic and volcaniclastic Jurassic rocks of shallow marine origin. In the area was also documented an erosional, locally angular unconformity which separates a Lower Jurassic unit from a Middle (?) to Upper Jurassic unit with previously reported Late Jurassic fauna in the upper part of the succession. Limestone layers in the upper part of the Jurassic succession, are recrystallized as marbles, especially in the area of the Plomosas mine, where both the metamorphism of these limestones and the presence of stratabound ore bodies of lead and zinc seem to be related to thrusting with a tectonic transport to the southwest and northwest, that placed very fractured Permian sandstones and siltstones over the Upper Jurassic rocks. The faulting is possibly associated with transpression along the so-called Plomosas lineament and transcurrent faulting, described as a left lateral shear of the basement whose regional trace lies along the eastern front of the sierra. Finally south of the Sierra Plomosa, in the northeast trending Sierra de Santo Domingo Carboniferous and Permian limestone are thrust over Jurassic sandstones and shale. This thrust fault also cuts a rhyolitic dyke of probable Oligocene age and can be considered as a very late laramide shortening contractive structure, possibly related to transpressive deformation along the Plomosas lineament and its interaction with the uplifted Cerro Carrizalillo block 15 km to the South of Plomosas.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/499/402

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Validation of digestion and element separation methods and a new data reduction program (IsotopeHf®) for Lu-Hf isotope dilution analysis by MC-ICP-MS,"The Lu-Hf isotope system is not only an important geochrono- meter but also a powerful tool for petrogenetic studies. To determine reliable analytical results of this system from rock and mineral samples, a protocol is established that includes appropriate sample digestion, a three-stage HREE-Hf ion-exchange separation procedure, a data acquisition protocol by MC-ICP-MS, and an R-based data reduction software package (IsotopeHf®) that transforms raw mass spectrome- try data into meaningful isotopic ratios, including all the necessary corrections for spiked samples. Our 176Hf/177Hf results of both mafic and felsic geochemical reference standards agree with those reported by other authors. However, results obtained using PicoTrace® pressure digestion system (DAS®) yield significantly higher 176Lu/177Hf for felsic rocks with high Hf content (> 15 ppm) compared to data obtained by Parr® bomb dissolution, indicating incomplete digestion of HFSE-rich phases like zircon under specific conditions of DAS® digestion. The high degree of Hf purity attained using our chemical procedure, MC- ICP-MS measurement protocol, and the IsotopeHf® program yielded accurate data with reliable and reproducible Lu-Hf isotope ratios within typical analytical uncertainties.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/501/403
