The mathematical model was developed from the Darcy law using Brinkman extension and an energy balance for the multiphase media. The governing equations were spatially discretized using orthogonal collocation with Legendre polynomials, with mesh 21x21 and 43x43; the time was discretized using and implicit Euler scheme. The resulting set of algebraic equations was solved via nonlinear relaxation. With this information, a computer code was developed using FORTRAN 90, that allows to estimate the dynamic heating and position of cold spots in particulate-food sterilization in still retort. The computer runs were performed with nutritional and thermodynamic data obtained for diverse canned foods as tuna in water; traditionally-baked beans and peas in brine. We observed that the required time for obtaining commercial sterility is practically the same if the viscosity of interstitial fluid is considered as temperature function or it is assumed at constant value. Furthermore, if Darcy number is increased, the required sterilization time decreases. In the case of peas in brine packed in 303x407 cans, a thermal processing time of 17 minutes is predicted for obtaining commercial sterility equivalent to F0 = 2.52 minutes,when the steam in the retort remains at 121° C",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2073/1076

KO11 strain contains, integrated into the chromosome, genes that code for pyruvate decarboxylase (PdcZm) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhBZm) from Zymomonas mobilis. Results indicate that KO11 has limited Pdc activity to channel carbon flux to ethanol formation from glucose or xylose. Hence, flux control is outside glycolysis and Pdc controls the ethanol flux. When intracellular activity of Pdc was increased 6 fold, the theoretical yield of ethanol on glucose or xylose was increased by 27%, during the stationary phase the ethanol flux was increased 42 and 44%, and the organic acid formation rate was reduced 46 and 76% for glucose or xylose, respectively. Furthermore, as a response to allosteric effects and a limited Pdc activity, an increase in the phosphofructokinase or pyruvatekinase enzymatic activity drastically reduces glucose consumption and ethanol formation flux, with a concomitant increase in organic acid formation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2074/1077

Data from the literature of cultures carried out at constant DOT was used. The model is able to explain that the main effect on the MMW of alginate is linked with the amplitude of the DOT sinusoidal wave. The model also predicts the weak effect of the oscillating DOT over kinetics of biomass growth, alginate production and sucrose consumption, as compared with cultures conducted at constant DOT.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2082/1081

The system kinetic and thermodynamic constants were obtained from a experimental system from the literature. The transport parameters were estimated using mathematical correlations for packed-bed columns and plasmids. The simulation studies were conducted using the numerical method of lines. This approach allowed to examine different strategies of design of the separation system, by means of parametric analysis and by system scale up.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2083/1082

The calculation of metabolic flows is fundamental in quantitative studies of cellular physiology. Metabolic flux analysis is a powerful tool for the determination of the flows in the network of biochemical reactions. Intracellular fluxes are calculated using a stoichiometric model that describes the biochemistry of the microorganism. Metabolic flux analysis is particularly useful in connection with studies of metabolite production, where the objective is to direct as much carbon as it is possible from a substrate towards a metabolic product, besides to allow the calculation of nonmeasured extracellular fluxes and maximum theoretical yields, identification of alternating metabolic pathways and branched nodes of metabolic control. This work presents a revision of methodologies of consistency and metabolic flux analysis and their application to fermentation systems.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2087/1084

Several of these isomers have been associated with important biological roles, including anti carcinogenic activity. Basically, the natural sources of CLA are dairy and meat products. However, its presence in such foods is in very small quantities. The present work was undertaken to evaluate the effect of temperature (40, 50, 60 and 70°C), molar ratio of substrates (3:1 and 4:1, free fatty acid: glycerol), and two commercially available biocatalysts [Candida antarctica fraction B (Chyrazyme L-2), and Rhizomucor miehei (IM-60)], on the rate of production of triacylglycerols (TAG) from glycerol and CLA via enzyme-mediated polyesterification reactions. The formation of acylglycerols and the consumption of the free fatty acids were monitored by periodic withdrawal of samples for analysis by HPLC. Best treatments were selected by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test (p<0.05). The conditions which produced maximum synthesis of TAG (76% ±2.7 moles of the original fatty acid were esterified to form TAG), were those in which free fatty acid was used in molar excess (4:1 mole ratio of CLA to glycerol) and high temperatures (60 and 70°C) were employed. For these conditions, there were no significant differences between the results obtained with either commercial enzyme. For both enzymes, a linear relationship was observed between the production of the TAG and the reaction temperature",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2088/1085

For the case of Food Engineering, these fundamentals are adapted to improve the traditional preservation processes, as well to optimize the energy use. In this way, the fundamentals of momentum, heat, and mass transfer are applied to a deep analysis of complex processes. This is the case of thermal process of foods in containers subjected to convection as the main mechanism of heating and cooling. In this work, a brief review of the evolution of mathematical and computational applications to the analysis of convective heating in canned foods is presented. In addition, a general idea of the state of the art of this topic is presented as an example of an engineering application of a subject related to biotechnological processes; particularly, the processing and preservation of foods",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2089/1086

Presence of CWMS in gellan gels decreased hardness and increased springiness and cohesiveness. In PTP, all gels exhibited fracture, however, the presence and concentration of AMCE had an important effect in fracture characteristics. As CWMS concentration increased, fracture force decreased between 78.4 and 45.7% compared to gellan alone. A similar behavior was observed for distance at fracture. Although the linear viscoelasticity region was not reached, the stress relaxation curves showed a good fit to Maxwell Generalized model and the use of an empirical model revealed that gels with CWMS in their formulation, exhibited a higher solid-elastic behavior than those with gellan alone. Water loss due to syneresis showed a significant decrease while increasing starch concentration, in the order of 15.6% to 2.1%, depending on the concentration and applied deformation level.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2090/1087

It has been observed that cooling profiles, agitation rates and process time are important variables to determine the characteristics of the crystalline product. In this work sugar cane crystal surface areas are calculated, as function of time, from experimental results using three different cooling profiles (natural, lineal and cubic) and five agitation paths (step, exponential negative, constant, cubic and lineal). A shape factor is also determined from measurements on images obtained with a microscope.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2093/1089

One of the current trend is to exploit bioprocess integration and intensification approaches for the development of recovery and purification processes for biological products, particularly proteins. This article presents some cases of the results of the practical application of these approaches, using the techniques of aqueous two phase system and expanded bed adsorption. The experimental cases involve recovery of intracellular protein from baker´s yeast, in situ recovery of 6- pentyl-α-pyrone (coconut-like aroma compound) produced by Trichoderma harzianum, the development of a prototype process for the recovery of c-phycocyanin from Spirulina maxima and a new approach for the processing and recovery of inclusion bodies. It is expected that in the future the application of these strategies will facilitate the development of recovery systems for products of high commercial value and the optimization of already existing processes, attracting the attention of the industry for commercial applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2094/1090
