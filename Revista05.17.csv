Among these pilot plants, the Recirculation Catalyst Pilot Plant is the small-scale simulator that closer matches the behaviour of industrial units. This kind of pilot plants consists of riser, stripper, regenerator and separation column that perform duties similar to those of industrial units. Additionally, this pilot plant is able to operate using a descendant flow reactor (downer) in order to emulate several technological trends; which operation mode promises better selectivity. FCC process involves many variables interconnected in complex way, making a difficult task to predict its performance when operating far from original design conditions. Nevertheless, using the same catalyst, the same feedstock and the same main operating conditions of industrial units, it is possible to emulate the performance of industrial units in pilot plant. In this work, the characteristic relationship between pilot plant and industrial units is shown with examples of emulation, establishing its importance in research and support of technical services. Scaleup problems are addressed and solutions that mimic operating data from an industrial plant are found. Conversion results are shown graphically to easily assess industrial potential benefits that can be drawn from pilot plant emulation",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1878/966

METHODOLOGIES FOR ITS TREATMENT,"The effects of electronic correlation have been considered to describe correctly the behavior of the different matter systems (molecules, and solids); these models have been studied by means of ab-initio calculations (first principles). There are two points of view for it: Computational Quantum Chemistry and Computational Solid State Physics. Some interpretations have been detailed for this interaction and some methodologies it has been discussed to try them and their level of approximation. Also some cases are cited.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1886/974

Structural analysis (SEM-EDS) showed that the main crystalline phase of the samples was erionite (Er) with clinoptilolite in smaller proportions. Samples were exchanged (ErX) with alkaline (X = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+) and earth-alkaline metals (X = Sr+2, Ca+2, Ba+2 and Mg+2) to evaluate their N2 separation capacities from atmospheric air. In all samples the micropore volume (DR) coincides with the capacity of Langmuir monolayers. Therefore the concept of filling volume is more appropriate for these natural zeolites, which was essentially a microporous adsorbent (76% of micropore content). Chromatographic separation tests showed that ErSr, ErNa, ErCa and ErLi were the adsorbents with the highest capacity of N2-O2separation in atmospheric air.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1894/981

The effect of two different methods of cell disruption upon the release of the intracellular proteins produced by P. cruentum was evaluated. Cell disruption by sonication proved to be superior over manual maceration since a five time increase in the concentration of BPE released was achieved. The evaluation of partition behaviour of BPE in poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG)-sulphate, PEGdextran and PEG-phosphate ATPS was carried out to determine under which conditions the BPE and contaminants concentrated to opposite phases. ATPS formed with PEG of molecular weight of 1000 g/mol and phosphate proved to be suitable, after isoelectric precipitation at pH 4.0 for the recovery of highly purified BPE (defined as the absorbance ratio of A545nm to A280nm greater than 4.0) with a potential commercial value of $50 USD/mg. An ATPS extraction stage comprising PEG1000 29.5% w/w, phosphate 9.0% w/w, volume ratio (Vr) equal to 1.0, system pH of 7.0, loaded with BPE extract generated by precipitation (equivalent to the 40% w/w of the total extraction system), allowed BPE recovery with a purity of 4.1+0.2 and an overall product yield of 72% (w/w). The purity of BPE from the crude extract increased 5.9 fold after isoelectric precipitation and ATPS. The results reported herein demonstrated the benefits of the practical application of isoelectric precipitation together with ATPS for thedevelopment of a process to purify BPE produced by Porphyridium cruentum.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1903/988

AND LIMA BEANS FLOURS (Phaseolus lunatus L.),"The effect of extrusion on the physical properties of four blends of QPM corn (Zea mays L.) (M) and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) (F) were evaluated in order touse them in tho preparation of extruded snack products. The corn flour contained 11.7 % protein, 0.43 Lys and 0.1 % Trp and the bean flour 24.8 % protein, 1.98 % Lys and 0.33 % Trp. The corn/bean blends were prepared in proportions of 75M/25F, 50M/50F and 25M/75F (% weight). These blends and, flours of M and F were processed, in a single-screw extruder at 160 oC, 100 rpm and 12 % moisture content. The 75M/25F and 50M/50F blends were the best under the trial conditions. These blends did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in terms of expansion index (1.61 for 75M/25F; 1.46 for 50M/50F) and maximum force at break under compression (16.70 y 20.33 kgf respectively). They also had density levels of 298 kg/m3 for 75M/25F and 494 kg/m3 for 50M/50F. The 75M/25F blend provided 28 % more protein, 90 % more Lys and 58 % more Trp than the 100M, while the 50M/50F blend provided 56 % more protein, 180 % more Lys and 115 % more Trp thanthe 100M.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1904/989

These pigments seem to have many physiological functions that include a role as antioxidant and provitamin “A”. A common characteristic of shrimps is their pink flesh when cooked. Dietary carotenoids, among them astaxanthin, are the responsible for the ability of captured shrimps for developing their characteristic color when cooked. These carotenoids are sourced mainly from krill and phytoplankton. However, for cultured shrimps carotenoids are not available unless included in their feeds. The current limited production of astaxanthin cannot meet the growing demand for this pigment, so that scientists have strived to find new alternative sources for this pigment. Carotenoids from plant sources seem to provide an interesting option to this problem. The present study is aimed at showing the state of the art in the research on the use of pigments from plant extracts and their potential for their incorporation in the feed of shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei). Some promising alternative plant sources for the pigment astaxanthin are the carotenoids from the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma, the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, Dunaliella salina and Spirulina , the petals from Adonis aestivalis and Tagetes erecta, the red chili bells from Capsicum annuum and the leguminous Leucaena leucocephala. Many of these carotenoids sources have been used at concentrations of 100 to 450 mg/kg in the diet of shrimps, and in particular for the white shrimp (L. vannamei), a marked increase of carotenoid content in the exoskeleton and abdomen has been observed. This suggests that the different carotenoids contained in plant extracts such as zeaxanthin, lutein and capsanthin are converted into astaxanthin",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1905/990
