The capacity of Penicillium to accumulate mycelial lipids has been recognized for decades. But, their potential as lipid producer from cellulosic substrates is limited. This study deals with the lipid production from a cellulosic substrate (seaweed bagasse) by the new isolate Penicillium decumbens M11. This fungus produces 6 mg of total lipids per gram of seaweed bagasse (mg/g). When a 23factorial design was applied to study the effects of temperature, water fraction, and C/N ratio on lipid production, the fungus increased their lipid accumulation to 97 mg/g at 28°C, a C/N ratio of 50 and a water fraction of 50%. Palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and stearic acids were the most abundant fatty acids.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/718/243

SmF cultures of P pastoris presented moderate lysis without methanol (MetOH) after 72 h. Addition of MetOH has negligible effect on SSF system at the same conditions. MetOH addition produced lysis in both types of cultures, but nearly three times more for SmF than for SSF. Maximal biomass levels were higher (52 gL-1) for SSF as compared to SmF (42 gL-1). Microscopic observations showed smaller yeast aggregates in SmF as compared to larger aggregates in SFF. This is the first work that shows lower yeast autophagy when cultured in large aggregates within the polyurethane foam as well as lower methanol toxicity as compared to shake flask cultures. Such results could be explained in terms of possible cell to cell communication and also in terms of diffusion barriers to methanol in large yeast aggregates. This work opens the possibility of using polyurethane foam support of SSF systems as a way to increase recombinant protein production using glycerol as starting substrate and methanol as a late inducer of specific operons.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/730/249

Filamentous fungi have different growth patterns (as mycelia, clumps, and pellets) in industrial processes. Therefore, the study of the morphology presented by this group of organisms is necessary to establish the conditions of production of new products or to improve the existing processes, even at the laboratory scale. Among the various forms of fungal growth, the formation of pellets represents many advantages in bioprocesses, and thus it is interesting to determine the factors that induce it. This manuscript describes the state of the art of fungal pellets, provides information on conditions of both inoculation and incubation that favor the formation of pellets at laboratory scale, as well as the advantages, applications and perspectives that pellets have in the field of biotechnology.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/719/244

In this work, the production of lipase (Lip, U/g) was investigated from Penicillium roqueforti using cocoa shell as a substrate for semi-solid fermentation. The optimization of cultivation conditions were aw = 0.888 / T = 26.7°C / t = 60 h), which showed a productivity of 0.299 ± 0.031 Ug-1h-1. The enzymatic extract presented an optimal pH and a T of 6.8 and 35.5°C respectively; a thermal stability (50°C) showed a half-life estimated at 50 min. and the addition of the solvents dichloromethane or methyl ether or the addition of the salts CoCl2, Pb(C2H3O2)2or MgCl2to the incubation buffer favored the Lip activity. The results showed that cocoa shell can be used as aviable substrate for Penicillium roqueforti to produce enzyme extracts, which is a promising alternative for the production. It also contained, for example, lipases with characteristics like those described in the literature.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/731/250

Bioremediation tackles this issue by using living organisms and metabolites such as bioemulsifiers (BEs) which can pseudo-solubilise hydrocarbons making them more accessible for biodegradation. The aims of this work were (i) to produce in an airlift bioreactor a novel BE through the UAM25 strain, (ii) to evaluate the BE emulsifying activity and stability against commercial emulsifiers using three PAHs, and (iii) to characterize the biomolecule after purification. The UAM25 strain, produced a high molecular weight (1,010 kDa) macromolecule when grown in an airlift bioreactor with n-hexadecane as its sole carbon and energy source. Under these conditions, the yield was 150 mg·L −1 of pure BE with 160 emulsifying activity units. The BE emulsified nhexadecane and β-methylnaphthalene, as well as blends of pyrene and phenanthrene in a non-specific mode. This novel BE displays an exopolysaccharide (repeated rhamnose and galactose units) structure different from previously reported within the same bacterial genus. We observed remarkable PAH-emulsifying capabilities in the BE, compared to commercial emulsifiers such as Tween 80 and Triton X-100. Our work suggests potential biotechnological applications to enhance the bioremediation of soil, sediments, and water",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/928/323

Coffee is one of the most important drinks in the world producing several residues such as coffee pulp, which is considered a contaminant if not properly disposed. This residue causes damage to the fauna from rivers due to its composition including tannins, pH 3.5, (1-4%) caffeine, polyphenolic compound, ochratoxin A, the presence of the latter three have toxic or nephrotoxic effects on higher animals. For these reasons, a study on the use of these residues to obtain high-added value products as enzymes of biotechnological interest, was performed. The enzyme production was optimized using the response surface methodology in a composite central design to study pH, moisture and fermentation time using endoglucanase activity as the response variable. The enzymatic activities found were - glucosidases, endoglucanases, exoglucanases and xylanases which were able to function under acidic (4.0-5.5) and basic (7.5-8.0) conditions. Additionally, protein extract was used on agroindustrial residues as substrate to evaluate reducing sugar production",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/929/324

Three ratios (60:40, 65:35 and 70:30 v:v) of Agave americana L. honey and panela honey respectively to 22° Brix were used for must formulation and three times of fermentation (24, 48 and 72 hours) were used. Volatile compounds of white and aged “comiteco” spirits were identified by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, and sensory profile was determined using sommeliers and judged semi-trained. The ratio 65:35 v/v (Agave americana: panela honey to 22 ºBrix) fermented by 48 hours had the higher ethanol yield 30.85 g/L and allowed to obtain “comiteco” with the best sensorial properties. Ageing process improved the sensory properties of white “comiteco” spirit and decreased alcoholic odor. Therefore, Kluyveromyces marxianus strain LEV-03-ITTG could be considered as yeast with potential to industrial production of “comiteco” spirit",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/932/325

Through this statistical methodology, it was possible to identify the best conditions to maximize the response variables which were 15 minutes for equilibrium time, 30 minutes for extraction time and 45 °C for extraction temperature. Using these conditions, 19 different volatile compounds were identified, with a profile that comprises compounds belonging to the following classes: carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, terpenoids and furans. Amongst these compounds, octanoic acid (caprylic acid) and decanoic acid (capric acid) can be highlighted with having larger relative areas, and they are volatile fatty acids that relate to the characteristic flavor presented in caprine milk",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/935/326

The average thickness of the TPS/5% NC/25% glycerol films was 81 ± 3 µm, and it was 91± 2 µm for the TPS/5% OC/25% glycerol films. Both the X-ray diffraction and infrared analyses showed that the glycerol and starch molecules can be intercalated into the clay galleries. A good dispersion of the components in the mix was observed via an electron scanning microscope. Using the nanoindentation method, it was observed that the materials with the highest elasticity had the lowest amount of clay and the highest concentration of glycerol. The moisture permeability of the films was reduced by 80% in the presence of the clay materials utilized in this study.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/938/330

A concentrate of PUFA n-3 (81.5% w/w) was prepared by chemical hydrolysis of sardine oil followed by treatment with urea. Esterification reactions were conducted using a ratio of 2.62 mol n-3 PUFA/mol glycerol in sealed glass jars, continuously agitated at constant temperature (55°C). Samples were taken at different times and the content of acylglycerols were analyzed by HPLC-ELSD. A kinetic model was developed based on a multisubstrate multi-product ping-pong mechanism to interpret the experimental data. The parameters of the model were estimated by nonlinear regression without restrictions on a MATLAB® platform (R2014a), with a coecient of determination (R2 > 0.9). The model obtained can aid in the design and scaling of reactors for enzymatic esterification reactions",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/939/331

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of open sun drying and hot air drying methods, as well as pretreatments on capsaicin, capsanthin, and ascorbic acid content in chiltepin. Chiltepin was dried using open sun and hot air drying. Raw chiltepin showed capsaicin (C) and capsanthin (CAPS) content of 5,560 µg/g dry weight (dw) and 58.7 µg/g dw, respectively; ascorbic acid (AA) concentration (140 µg/g dw) was lower to that reported in other peppers. Open sun drying affected the concentrations of CAPS (12.09 µg/g dw) and AA (3.5 µg/g dw), but not C (5,500 µg/g dw). In hot air drying, the lowest temperature (35 °C) favored retention of bioactive compounds of 90%, 52%, and 35% (C, CAPS, and AA, respectively). These results suggest that C is the most stable compound. Thus, hot air drying can be recommended for a higher retain of CAPS and AA compounds",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/941/332

During these stages important minority compounds are generated such as the methanol, which is generated throughout the demethoxylation of the pectin in agave and that is toxic to humans, being strictly regulated in alcoholic beverages. This work evaluated the methanol production during the cooking of Agave angustifolia, from 92 to 122°C for 12 to 18 h. A first order kinetic model was developed, finding that the energies of activation of 90.64 and 115.96 kJ/mol for demethoxylation in stem and leaves, respectively. During cooking, the degree of demethoxylation of pectin reached 92%. It was estimated that most of the methanol produced was removed onto the water steam that was generated during cooking.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/944/333

This typical Mexican vegetable is consumed in certain regions after a thermal processing, namely, boiling, frying or steaming. Some reports indicate that quintonil contains nutritive compounds such as, vitamins, proteins, chlorophyll, phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify lipid fractions and to obtain the fatty acid profile of quintonil leaves, as well as to assess the effect of thermal processing (boiling and steaming) on such profile. Our data showed that palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and α-linolenic (ALA) acids were present. ALA was the predominant residue in all the treatments: 1417.8 - 1667.5 mg/100g (fresh), 1621.4 - 1667.5 mg/100g (boiled) and 1437.9 - 1912.6 mg/100g (steamed). A similar behaviour was observed for the other fatty acids, indicating that thermal processing did not affect the fatty acid profile of quintonil. Conversely, it seemed to favour their availability. This research promotes quintonil consumption because of its health implications in an attempt to preserve Mexican biodiversity and revaluate this ancient crop.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/953/339

Total carbohydrates (TC), reducing sugars (RS), total fructan (FRU), glucose, fructose content, and average polymerization degree (DPn) were evaluated. Fructan extraction kinetics and mass transfer coefficients (KL) were calculated. RS and TC were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by temperature; FRU, by UP. Glucose, fructose, DPn, and KL were affected (P < 0.05) by UP and temperature. TC and FRU reached maximum values at 54-59.0 W and 36.0 °C. KL reached a maximum at 55 W and 33.5 °C. The opposite trend was observed for glucose and fructose, presenting minimum values under these conditions, indicating minimal fructan damage. Under these conditions, DPn values ranged from 4.18 to 4.7 with maximum FRU of 7.97 g·100 g−1 sotol d.m. Thermal treatment led to higher release of TC and RS and lower DPn compared with UAE, but showed similar FRU.

The most stable formulation according to three response variables: particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP) and Turbiscan stability index (TSI) was obtained. Data were analysed by using an ANOVA test. Results showed that wall materials have a synergic influence on PS and TSI and antagonic for ZP. PS increased with the proportion of GA while ZP and TSI were affected by the charge of the wall materials. Optimum emulsion resulted in a mixture of 3.28% GA, 13.33% MD and 3.37% MS; Predicted and experimental values of the response variables were very similar among them.

However, modeling the extension of the resulting boundary layers has been the subject of a long debate in the literature. In specific, modeling of momentum transport between a porous medium and a fluid has suggested the inclusion of additional terms to Darcy’s law. The origin of such corrections may be regarded as a result of an upscaling method used to derive the governing equation at the Darcy scale. To address this issue, in this work we perform pore-scale simulations in an idealized porous medium model consisting in arrays of straight channels that allow obtaining analytical expressions for the Darcy-scale velocity profiles by performing an averaging (instead of an upscaling) operation. Our results show the dependence of the size and shape of transition layers with the size of the averaging domain when studying momentum transport between a porous medium and a fluid but also near the porous medium-wall boundary.With this low-computationally demanding methodology, we can conclude that the existence of an average velocity boundary layer, and thus the pertinence of correction terms to Darcy’s law, is certainly justified",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/986/357

COLUMN MODELING AND ADSORPTION KINETICS STUDIES,Chromium (VI) removal from water was studied using two varieties of pecan nut husks (PNHs): Barton and Native. Influent Cr(VI) solutions at dierent pH values (2.5 and 6.18) and particle sizes (0.42 and 0.85 mm) were performed. Both PNH varieties showed reduction to Cr(III) and adsorption of Cr(VI) and Cr(III). The Thomas model adequately (R2 of 0.79-0.94) describes the Cr(VI) adsorption for Barton PNH. Microscopy studies of PNH morphology showed some morphological changes attributed to chromium retention. The Barton PNH variety presented a higher Cr(VI) absorption with a longer exhaustion time (15-30 min) for both particle sizes. Native PNH for both particle sizes with a pH of 6.18 had the highest concentrations at equilibrium but short exhaustion time (10-15 min). PNH could be a sustainable alternative material for the Cr(VI) removal from contaminated waters,,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/988/358

An electrokinetic unit was built which included a pair of stainless steel electrodes (anode and cathode) to apply a low potential gradient, MSS was used as source of nutrients and mixed to ensure aerobic conditions. Two indigenous microorganisms were isolated from the contaminated soil (Aspergillus sp and Flavobacterium sp), selected because of their high diesel degradation potential and used in batch reactor bioremediation tests. It was demonstrated that electric current applied, addition of nutrients, and oxygen accelerated the microbial growth of native microorganisms in EBR experiments (6.13 ± 1.22 ×1013 CFU/mL) and were higher than in BR tests (4.57 ± 0.80 ×1013 CFU/mL); and a higher hydrocarbons removal efficiency (EBR: 86.67 ± 2.23% vs BR: 73.18 ± 3.16%), after 190 hours of treatmen",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/989/359

Low cost ecofriendly adsorbent has been investigated as alternative to expensive methods for removing dyes. Bacterial laccases have been found from activated sludge; however, their contribution has yet not been quantified. Activated sludge (AS), sludge with certain grade of permeability (PS) and sludge supported onto activated carbon (ACAS) were used to evaluate their capacity to discolor ab74. The zymogram and the oxidation of 2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) confirmed the presence of laccases either AS or PS. Inhibition assays also evidenced the contribution of laccases to discolor ab74; achieving discoloration of 23.2 % and 19.09 % for AS and PS, respectively. The discoloration of ab74 was found to be more effective in the ACAS cultures than AS and PS. ACAS displayed an interesting synergic effect for ab74 discoloration of 76.6±11 % of efficiency and specific discoloration rate of 5.9±0.4 mg ab74 /h gtreatment. A novel insight is that the activated sludge was able to regenerate in situ the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon; these results are promising to be applied inwastewater treatment technologies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/990/360

Thus, the detection of some key microbial groups may serve as one way to detect soil conditions around petrol stations. The aim of this study was to quantify 5 microbial groups in soil and fuel samples from 7 facilities in Joao Pessoa, Brazil: total heterotrophic bacteria, hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, acid-producing bacteria, iron bacteria and total filamentous fungi. In soil samples, the microbial density was low (100 -107 CFU/g) revealing a pronounced impact on the microbiota (TPH in soil ranged from 10,000 to 12,000 mg/Kg). In diesel samples, a density ranging 10−1 -103 MPN/mL was detected, especially hydrocarbonoclastics and acid-producing bacteria, which suggests involvement of microbes in possible corrosion processes inside the tank. The results indicated that the microbial groups analyzed are potential indicators of soil quality in petrol stations. Phytotoxicity tests indicated a high degree of contamination among 42% of the facilities and Zea mays was the best ecotoxicity indicator.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/992/361

We have examined the effects of pressures and hydrogen dilutions on chemical and structural characteristics of pm-Si:H, and how these characteristics influence on the optoelectronic and photodegradation properties of the material. By Raman spectroscopy, the nano-structural character of material was determined in terms of average size and crystalline fraction. With UV-VIS the optical gap of each film was determined, finding that this value is modified according to nano-structural characteristics of this material. By XPS, incorporation of oxygen in the samples with largest nanoclusters, was found. With FTIR, bond configurations associated to photo-stability of the material were found, which was confirmed by measuring photoconductivity, through prolonged intensities of light soaking of 94mW/cm2 at controlled temperature, finding greater photo-stability in the samples where Oxygen was found.

Based on these methods, a new Microsoft Office Excel add-in was developed, SphereSolver, aiming to enhance the ability to use this easily obtainable software as a simulation computing platform for engineering problems. SphereSolver was applied over different types of engineering models and the non-linear equations were solved successfully each time. Selected problems were solved with SphereSolver and compared with other solution tecniques, e.g., classical Newton’s method, Fixed Point homotopy or Affine Homotopy. It was observed that using SphereSolver the solution for selected problems was improved, i.e., the interval of convergence is extended massively and/or additional roots can be found. It can be concluded that SphereSolver is a new and effcient tool that can be used within Microsoft Excel for solving engineering problems where other software or traditional tools could fail or present limitations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1094/407

Anhydrous ethanol composition was higher than 97%. The influence of operating parameters on the efficiency of each simulated technology was determined by analyzing three alternatives. Temperature, molar flows of liquid and vapor and composition profiles through the columns were analyzed for each process.

However, the air/fuel ratio for any blend is not found in the literature. It is found only for specific values such as: E10, E50 and E85 for example. For this reason, in the present work a mathematical model is presented to determine the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of the ethanol-gasoline blend in the range between 0% to 100% of ethanol molar percentage in the blend. The model is based on combustion chemical analysis for any composition ethanol-gasoline. The optimum compression ratio for maximum network is also obtained, considering isentropic processes during compression and expansion. The analysis of the Otto cycle with the air/fuel model and optimum compression ratio is developed. Results show that the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of the blend ethanol-gasoline is not linear. The maximum difference between air/fuel ratios predicted and experimentally reported is 7% in the whole range of the blend. The analysis of the Otto cycle, using the equation derived shows that the power and the torque decrease when the ethanol mole fraction grows. The equations obtained in this work can be used to predict the performance of internal combustion engines using the ethanol-gasoline blend in the continuous range of ethanol molar percentage between 0% and 100%",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1103/412
