(B1), with sporesRhizopussp. (B2) and a mixture of sporesColletotrichumsp. +Rhizopussp. (B3). Using the biodegradator (B3) was obtained the highest degradation of the plantain rachis being of 42.91%, and the leachates production was of 80 mL with pH of 7.96 on the 30thday of the experimentation. The banana rachis degraded by the mixture of spores ofColletotrichumsp. +Rhizopussp. (B3) showed the lowest organic carbon content being of 29.52% and the highest nitrogen content being of 2.30%, generating a Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 12.84%. The results evidenced that the biodegradator composed by the mixture ofColletotrichumsp. +Rhizopussp. (B3) can be used to increase the degradation of the plantain rachis encouraging the use of this biomass in the composting process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/707/282

In this investigation 70 thermophilic cellulolytic fungal strains were isolated. All the strains were screened via submerged fermentation. The strain showing highest CMCase activity was identified by conventional method i.e.  based on morphology and microscopic features and confirmed by 18SrDNAgene sequencing, using specific ITS primers. The modified CTAB method was used for rapid extraction of DNA from thermo tolerant strain.  The selected strain subsequently subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The result indicates the selected strain was found to beT. dupontii.For strain improvement theT. dupontiiwas subjected to random mutagenesis by using (UV) irradiation and EMS treatment. Out of 40 screened mutantT. dupontiiEMS 15 had 2.4 fold more yield (21.8 U/ml/min) as compared to parental strain. The Five fermentation media were also screened. The Medium3 gave higher titer of cellulase activity (29.3 U/ml/min) and found to be the best medium.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/823/312

Their identification and quantification allow an adequate monitoring and understanding of the bioprocess. In this work, a HPLC methodology for simultaneous determination of glucose, glycerol, ethanol and citric, pyruvic, succinic, lactic, formic, acetic and propionic acids was validated, presenting adequate selectivity and linearity. Matrix effect was observed for citric and lactic acids, glycerol and ethanol. The limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0.006 to 0.021 g.L-1and 0.018 to 0.065 g.L-1, respectively. Recovery values were between 89 and 109% and variation coefficients were less than 2.3%. The intermediate precision was verified with short-term stability, after one freezing and thawing cycle and analysis by a second analyst. The analysis of fermentation samples showed that Actinobacillus succinogenes’s metabolism was carbon source dependent, while Basfia succiniciproducens presented similar metabolic behavior for the carbon sources evaluated, with less variety of generated products. Succinic acid represented around 37% and 25% of products originated by fermentation of glucose and glycerol sources, respectively, using A. succinogenes. Meanwhile, maximum succinic acid production was equivalent to 50% and 80% of metabolites produced in the fermentation of glucose and glycerol sources by B. succiniciproducens.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/747/315

We have produced this recombinant protein in shake flask and stirred tank bioreactor. Initial results in shake flask cultures under different methanol concentration of 0.5, 1.5 and 3% (v/v) produced extracellular protein at quantities of 10, 22 and 33 μg/mL, respectively. Then a scale-up process was performed from shake flask to fermenter by keeping similar volumetric power supply (P/V). The operational conditions were set up in fermenter as those used at commercial scale and supply of pure oxygen was avoided to keep the scalability of the bioprocess. After the scale-up process, the production of the recombinant protein reached 0.43 mg/mL, an improvement in production of 12 times, although the methanol and oxygen limited conditions observed. Maximum volumetric productivity of 3.75 mg/L h was achieved in fermenter cultures against 263.75 µg/L h reached in shake flask. Besides the limited conditions in methanol and oxygen, the yields obtained from the bioprocess were comparable to those observed in Mut+strains previously reported, then saturated methanol conditions are not necessary to compensate limited oxygen conditions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/725/316

The present study evaluates the feasibility of the enzyme to degrade high cyanide concentrations and the possible metabolic pathways involved, for which the protein concentration and cyanide detoxification activity were quantified. Bacterial cells grown in cyanide incorporated medium were disrupted by sonication and the resultant cell free extract were tested for metabolic pathway. The cell free extract was precipitated by ammonium sulphate precipitation and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography using DEAE cellulose. The maximum enzyme activity achieved was 2125 µM/min. The partially purified enzyme was found to be able to detoxify 82% of 2 mM KCN in 10 min of incubation and cyanide degradation (or depletion) rate showing a linear increase with increasing enzyme concentration. The effective accruing of ammonia as metabolite illustrated that the detoxification was ensued via the function of cyanide dihydratase. Additional confirmation through SDS-Page showed that the molecular weight of enzyme was assessed to be ~38 kDa, which is tandem with the reported cyanide dihydratases. Hence, the use of enzyme as a substitute to live bacterial cells in detoxification of cyanide illustrates various advantages such as the capacity to withstand and detoxify higher cyanide concentration and total reduction in the total cost of process since nutrient provision is immaterial.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/785/329

Some reports have demonstrated that different fructan chain lengths have different effects on the growth of intestinal microbiota bacterial communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate two agave fructan fractions on the growth of probiotic and pathogenic bacteria cultured in a gastrointestinal tract simulator. The growth was carried out by plate count using media selective for each different bacterial type. In addition, the metabolites generated via fructan metabolism were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that these fructan fractions possess prebiotic activities and have beneficial effects via inhibition of intestinal pathogen growth. These effects particularly depend on the length of the selected fructan fraction administration period. This knowledge is important for enhancing the selective use of prebiotics in functional foods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/842/343

Its production is drastically affected byColletotrichum gloeosporioides, one of the main pathogens responsible for anthracnose disease. Several techniques as an alternative of conventional chemical treatments for disease control have been studied. Among these techniques, the use of antagonist microorganism has emerged as a promising, eco-friendly alternative for postharvest disease control. This review is focused on the inhibition ofColletotrichumgloeosporioidesin papaya applying microbial antagonists. Furthermore, the main purpose of this study is to provide the results ofin vivoandin vitroassays, that addressed the use of microorganisms and their activity as biocontrol agents in papaya, considering its application to diminish crop losses and suggesting possible future researches addressed to their attractive usage.

The use of MPW could also decrease BC cost since the use pure sugars for its obtaining is expensive. The effect of different nitrogen sources and buffer addition to MPW-medium on the polymer yield was also investigated. Using MPW and yeast extract as a nitrogen source, a production of 6.32 g/L of BC was obtained after 16 days of static culture.  BC was characterized by SEM, XRD, TGA, FTIR and Water holding capacity (WHC). Chemical structure and thermal degradation of BC produced from MPW were similar to those of BC obtained with pure sugars (350°C). Crystallinity index of BC produced in mango-based medium was lower (62.7 % vs. 77.2 %); WHC was higher (108.7 % vs.  88.7 %); and fiber diameter was smaller (98.8 nm vs. 50.6 nm).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/743/347

The AuNPs are synthesized by physical, chemical and biological methods; the green synthesis is a eco-friendly method based on biological principles that have functional groups serving as reducing agents and stabilizers in the reaction. The objective of this work was the optimization in the conditions for AuNPs synthesis using Hypericum perforatum and assess the antimicrobial activity of optimal treatments obtained. The AuNPs were synthesized by the combination of biological and physical methods, characterized by FTIR, spectrophotometry, TEM and DLS; and the antimicrobial effect of the optimized AuNPs was evaluated. The smallest particle size obtained was 20 nm, however not all AuNPs showed antimicrobial activity, the minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations were 0.42 and 0.84 μg AuNPs/mL, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to develop and characterize films based on linseed mucilage (LM) at concentrations of 2.0%, 2.5%, and 3.0% and the further development of antimicrobial films (AFs) incorporatingHamamelis virginiana(Hv) extract. The films with the greatest LM concentration was selected as the best formulation based on its mechanical properties, water vapor permeability and moisture sensitivity. Moreover, the antimicrobial activities of Hv extract against foodborne pathogens were evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were 1.18 mg mL-1forL. monocytogenesand 2.37 mg mL-1forS. typhi, S. aureus,andE. coli. Finally, AFs were developed by incorporating Hv extract at 2.37 mg mL-1into a base of 3.0% LM, increasing elongation at break, antioxidant activity to 80.56%, moisture sensitivity, and antimicrobial activity (increasing inhibition zones to 19.50 – 22.50 mm).

Unfortunately, all these benefits are linked generally with their stability, which may be weak depending on the environment conditions. In this tenor, microencapsulation could be a technological option to preserve those molecules and provide them the desired stability. Furthermore, it may permit a better managing and masking of the astringent taste that most of phenolic compounds have.

One of the critical parameters which are traditionally monitored in the process is temperature; however, to date the measurement of this variable has not been carried out inside the corn kernel itself. In this study, heat transfer inside a corn kernel during the nixtamalization process was simulated by means of finite element analysis (FEA) in a tridimensional (3D) model. In addition, thermophysical properties of corn kernel [thermal conductivity (k), specific heat capacity (Cp) and bulk density (ρb)] were determined as a function of temperature (25, 50 and 75 °C). The magnitudes of the thermophysical properties increased with temperature and the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) was computed as 2143 ± 407 W/m2·K (NBi=0.0094). Also, the simulation model was good (R2adj> 0.99) and predictions showed that the corn kernel’s surface was rapidly heated and the alkaline solution’s temperature (85 °C) at corn kernel’s center was achieved at 80 s of heating. Furthermore, some predictions in the anatomical parts of the corn kernel were performed. This study contributes to the understanding and improvement of the optimal conditions of the nixtamalization process which allows saving energy, having economic rewards and obtaining high quality nixtamalized products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/792/327

In order to give it an added value, two ""clean"" technologies: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) were evaluated for obtaining their analytes. Results indicated that although higher yields were obtained by PLE, in general a higher concentration of compounds (gallotannins, flavonoids, xanthones, gallic acid, etc.) was obtained by SFE, except for Gallic acid due to its high solubility in pressurized water. The best results for SFE were obtained at 50 °C, 20 MPa and co-solvent flow rate corresponding to 20 % of the CO2flow; while for PLE the best condition was at 6.67 g.min-1Milli-Q water, 40 °C and 10 MPa.

The nanoparticles were loaded with krill oil, which is an important nutraceutical. The nanoparticles displayed different physicochemical characteristics depending on the assembly parameters chosen during their preparation. The fabrication process involved the use of biopolymer coatings (the protein b-lactoglobulin and the carbohydrate chitosan). Non-coated nanoparticles showed a particle size between 340-400 nm and surface charge of around -40 mV (pH 8.0). The protein copolymer b-lactoglobulin allowed the fabrication of smaller (d» 200 nm; z-potential » -60 mV) and more stable nanoparticles against pH changes (from 3.0 to 7.0). Chitosan was the best biopolymer coating for improving the antioxidant activity of the particles. The apparent pI for the different nanoparticles was modified after krill oil nanoencapsulation.

The experimental data were fitted to Spiro and Siddique model with a good accuracy () and the specific extraction rate constant was perfectly related to the apparent diffusivity using the lumped parameter model. The major percentage of the anthocyanin extraction yield was 63.81±1.33, 68.95 ±1.53, and 83.09±3.14 when the used solvent was H2O, H2O-EtaOH (90:10), and H2O-EtaOH (80:20), respectively.  The diffusivity was affected mainly by temperature, tending to be more temperature sensitive as the solvent polarity decreased. Activation energy values (), in range from 19.64 to 29.28 kJ mol-1, allow to infer that the extraction of anthocyanins is favored when using an ethanolic aqueous solution as a solvent.

The objective of the work was to evaluate the solid formation from nucleation to macroscopic properties of the mixture: sorbitan monopalmitate and ethyl cellulose in canola, olive and coconut vegetable oils. Nucleation kinetics, solid growth analysis, oscillatory rheology characterization, thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry and microstructural formation by optical microscopy were evaluated. Non-isothermal nucleation kinetics indicated short induction times for canola and prolonged in coconut, the inclusion of ethyl cellulose involved a more compact solid formation in the systems, without modifying the growth parameters, the coconut organogel was more sensitive to thermal changes. Non-isothermal nucleation kinetics are useful for determining the thermodynamic properties of organogels and the closest to thermodynamic equilibrium, the inclusion of ethyl cellulose being decisive; same that does not influence formation speed and solid growth.

By comparing the kinetic constants of both processes using Student-t statistic, significant differences (p <0.05) between them were found. Degradation reaction of 2,5-DCP in short times by solar photocatalysis, clearly showed a reaction order n = 1, reaching degradation of 75% (20 min), 83% (25 min) and up to 95% (30 min).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/732/280

The highest phenol removal was 82.39% at 55 rpm and 60% (v/v) diluted vinasses; the optimum values were obtained by canonical analysis. Rheological analysis was carried out with a stirrer and Peltier temperature control, and RheoPlus software. Vinasses showed a satisfactory adjustment to Herschel-Bulkley model, rheological index values (n>1) meaning dilatant flow. Temperature dependence models Arrhenius and Poiseuille were carried out. The kinetic analysis was fitted to Langmuir- Hinshelwood. High shear rates at the disks surface and the dilatancy increased vinasses viscosity, promoting the full contact to the semiconductor, increasing the removal efficiency. The effectiveness factor obtained (0.9981) explained that all the reaction is carried out at the catalyst surface. There was rheokinetic correlation found between the initial yield stress and removed concentration.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/673/314

Control of enzymatic browning for temperature effect, presence of inhibitors and complexation with b-cyclodextrin","Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) is an enzyme that produces enzymatic browning, which causes numerous losses in the industry. For this reason, the characterization and inhibition of PPO are very important. In this work were characterized PPOs from two types of pears (Pyrus communis L): White of Aranjuez (APPO) and Williams (WPPO), since this comparison has not been done before. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were determined (APPO: 7 and 30ºC;WPPO: 7.5 and 24.5ºC). Both enzymes are heat-labile enzymes and exhibited similar behaviour against temperature. The enzymes analysed showed a higher affinity for 4-methylcatechol than for catechol. The inhibition of PPOs through ascorbic acids, 4-hexylresorcinol, sodium isoascorbate and citric acid was determined. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of b-Cyclodextrin, which results in the prevention of fruit oxidation because it forms an inclusion complex with the substrates, was evaluated.

The goal was to evaluate the kinetic behavior of nitrification, denitrification, and ANAMMOX on rhizosphere sludge, with and without chromium, through batch cultures, as well as the microbial structure using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The microbial sludge was able to nitrify (3.8 ± 0.2 mg NO3--N/gVSS-h) and carry out the ANAMMOX (0.67 ± 0.05 mg NH4+-N/gVSS-h), however, denitrifying activity was not observed. Chromium inhibited the nitrifying process, and the IC50obtained for the nitrifying activity was of 7.9 mg CrVI/L. ANAMMOX activity was stopped in the presence of chromium, even to the lowest chromium concentration tested. Recovery cultures showed that ANAMMOX bacteria suffered some damage by chromium presence since they required more than 5 days to recover the activity. Microbial results indicated thatXanthomonadaceae(17.17%),Ignavibacteriaceae(16.52%),Trueperaceae(10.66%) andChitinophagaceae(10.06%) dominated in the microbial sludge, whereasNitrosomonasandPlanctomycetaceaewere in lesser proportion.

In batch testing, it was used the statistical factorial experiments design, confirmed by verification tests utilizing various concentrations in water and subsequently in continuous flow in a pilot plant by oxidation under the Fenton process. Variables’ effects on contaminant degradation in water follow an order: pH > relation Fe2+/H2O2> time > [H2O2]. The Fenton process removes more than 50% of contaminants in COD testing and more than 70% in continuous testing. Easily oxidated organic matter consumes H2O2at the beginning of the process, whereas organic matter that was more difficult to degrade was oxidized with a hydroxyl radical (OH•).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/637/295

This study evaluated the use of cassava (Manihot esculenta), yam (Dioscorea alata) and plantain (Musa paradisiaca) starch, post-harvest residual, in the coagulation-flocculation process for the removal of turbidity in a synthetic water sample. The extraction of the starches was carried out by two methods: alkaline with NaOH and with deionized water. The starches obtained were characterized by physical analysis (color, state and pH), quantifying the nitrogen and carbon content. The effect of the coagulant concentration and the stirring rate on the coagulation-flocculation capacity of the starches under study were assessed as well. It was found that the plantain starch, obtained by both methods, reached the best percentages of turbidity reduction up to 94.6%, becoming an alternative to synthetic coagulants. The results presented in this basic study can be of great value for the scaling of starch production from these residues at an industrial level in the department of Bolívar, Colombia",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/740/311

The level of concentration of the 3MPA in aquatic environments is from nanomolar to micromolar. Also, 3MPA is toxic at certain concentrations and is used in experimentation to cause seizures in mice for scientific advances on epilepsy. Therefore, in this work, we report the developed of a novel portable, selective, and fast response sensor; based on an Au-TiO2electrode for the quantification of 3MPA.

A split plot experimental design was followed with two factors, temperature with four levels (40, 50, 60 and 70 °C), and agitation rate with 3 levels (150, 250 and 350 rpm); the response variables were density (as a measure of concentration) and crystal size distribution. The results allow to demonstrate that agitation rate does not exhibit a statistical effect on the MSZW for the crystallization of cane sugar, attributing the formation of nuclei and their growth to effects by changes in the temperature. This contributes to better understanding of the phenomenological behavior occurring in sugar cane crystallization.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/809/322

The factors investigated were the inlet temperature (150 to 220 °C), air flow (537 to 691 kg·h), and the frequency of the rotary atomizer (60 to 90 Hz). Analysis of variance revealed that the independent variables had significant effects (p<0.10) on the response variables. An increase in frequency of the rotary atomizer from 60 Hz to 90 Hz produced an increase in outlet temperature; and therefore, a decrease in product moisture content. The luminosity of the powders increased as the inlet temperature and air flow increase from 145 °C to 220 °C and from 537 kg·h-1to 691 kg·h-1, respectively; therefore, the powder coffee turned brighter.

The morphological characterization of the material with and without NCI was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the NCI was determined by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed thatEquisetum arvenseacts as a mixed-type NCI, achieving an inhibition efficiency of 53.78% when using 1000 ppm of NCI. From EIS the charge transfer resistance increased in the first 21 h, obtaining an inhibition efficiency of 87.5%. LPR results showed similar behavior than EIS at the same concentration.

It uses a DC plasma torch that decomposes and vaporizes salt precursors; the cationic part condenses as metal nanoparticles on a powder support. Any fluidizable granular material can be used as support, as long as it withstands the temperatures of the plasma torch. The torch is located at the center of the reactor axis and the powder is fluidized using a cyclonic action (swirl) to minimize the space where the grains could come into direct contact with the plasma zone. The reactor was tested for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) supported on silica-alumina, using silver nitrate as precursor. The results show large grains decorated with nano-sized metal particles. Depending on the load of silver nitrate, the size of the nanoparticles can range from 3 to 50 nm, as measured using transmission electron microscopy. They are in a non-oxidized state, as revealed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The AgNPs/SiO2–Al2O3 composite was tested as a catalyst in the hydrodesulphurization of dibenzothiophene.

Materials were characterized by N2physisorption, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. SBA-15 had surface area greater than 800 m²/g that progressively decreased with increasing TiO2content in binary materials. Very different hydrolysis rate of Ti and Si alkoxides could provoke encapsulation of segregated titania domains in SBA-15 structure. Highly reactive titanium butoxide hydrolysis-condensation could take place before reactions corresponding to tetraethyl orthosilicate. Pt dispersion clearly augmented with Ti concentration in composites where numerous tiny noble metal particles were observed on titania domains surface. Also, corresponding pore size maxima shifted to lower diameters (as to that of non-impregnated supports) after platinum loading suggested metallic crystals inside pores of Ti-modified carriers. However, some large cubic platinum crystals were also observed suggesting  sintering (during calcining at 500 °C) of metallic particles weakly interacting with SBA-15 component.
