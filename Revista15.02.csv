Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Spherical data validation of rock discontinuities orientation from Drone-derived 3D Point Clouds,"This work presents a methodology for the statistical validation of discontinuity surfaces obtained from point clouds using digital photogrammetry from drones. Our methodology allows you to review the quality of the data obtained with photogrammetry and decide whether these measurements are representative of the discontinuity surfaces that they analyze. It consists of three steps, the first one being a shape analysis that allows defining which statistical model should be used: Fisher for circularly symmetric clusters or Bingham fits better for axially symmetric clusters. This step also makes the most significant difference to other works since our methodology starts from the premise that not all discontinuity surfaces are flat. Therefore, Fisher parameters do not allow validating data that do not correspond to a plane.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1641/1430

Taxco de Alarcón, Guerrero, in southern Mexico has had aWWTPoperating since 2016, and theSSdisposal is a task that must be addressed by theWWTP. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth capacity ofPanicum maximum, also known as mombaza grass (MG), by usingSSgenerated within the ""Taxco de Alarcón wastewater treatment plant"" as substrate. To do so, 4 g ofMGseeds were scattered over 5 kg (dry basis) ofSS. As a control, a commercial compost soil was used, hereafter called pattern soil (PS). The experiment was carried out in triplicates for three months and drinking water (water used for human consumption) was used for crop irrigation. Each month aMGharvest was carried out. The response variables analyzed forMGwere germination time (one month after plant emergence), height (HMG), growth rateGrMG, and yield (YMG), whereas in theSSandPSthe content of organic matter was analyzed. Furthermore, the chemical composition was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) on theMG,SS, andPS. The results showed thatMGgerminated faster onPS(5 days) than germination onSS(7 days). However, theMGgrown onSSreached a considerably higher height (45 cm) compared to the height reached onPS(17 cm). Furthermore, the maximumGrMGoverSSwas also higher than the maximumGrMGobserved on thePS, 3.64 and 1.40 cm∙day-1, respectively. In terms ofYMG, it was observed that onSSit reached an average monthlyYMGof 416 g∙m-2, whereas inPSit reached aYMGof 72 g∙m-2. The chemical analysis detected P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, considered macronutrients in both substrates. Besides, some micronutrients identified inSSwere Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, whereas inPSit was also possible to detect micronutrients except Mn and Zn. All the macronutrients detected in the substrates were observed in the harvestedMG. However, in theMGharvested inPS, Mn and Zn were not detected. Hence, a feasible disposal strategy for theSSgenerated by the Taxco de AlarcónWWTPis as a substrate for grass forageMGby its high organic matter content, the significant presence of macro and micronutrients, and the performance shown byMGcultivated inSS. Furthermore, theSScharacteristics provide added value and can be considered as organic amendments of agricultural soils.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1617/1432
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Mobile mud layer underneath the desiccated maar lake of Rincón de Parangueo and insights into its microbial fingerprints,"We surveyed a subsurface layer of saturated mobile mud and its microbial fingerprints below the desiccated bottom of a maar lake at Rincón de Parangueo (RP), Mexico. A multi-scale approach was followed using geological fieldwork, coring of the sediments, ground penetrating radar survey, physico-chemical characterization including X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope, and high-throughput DNA sequencing methods. The mobile mud is an organic-rich silty clay, with high values of alkalinity, volumetric water content and conductivity. Mud mobility has been attributed to overpressure caused by disequilibrium compaction of sediments related to active subsidence and pore overpressure produced by an input of groundwater and gas content in the sediments and resulted in a diverse set of structures related to mud tectonics such as injection domes and fluid seeps through fractures. Extraction and sequencing of sedimentary environmental DNA in the mud layer were performed for Bacteria and Archaea. Despite the small number of samples obtained, the microbial fingerprint from the sedimentary environmental DNA at subsurface shares similarities with the microbial communities identified on the crater surface. Additionally, we identify the DNA of specific methanogenic microorganisms in the mud, such as Bathyarchaeia, Methanomassiliicoccales, and Methanobacteriales, and we speculate on their probable role in gas production and pore overpressure in the mud layer. The underground mud at Rincón de Parangueo represents a geologically dynamic environment with conditions that are favorable for the thriving of microbial communities.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1636/1433

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geology and geochemistry of jasperoids from the ‘Montaña de Manganeso’ district, San Luis Potosí, north-central Mexico","Large outcrops of jasperoids occur in the ‘Montaña de Manganeso’ mining district in north-central Mexico. They range from massive manganiferous jasperoids to highly brecciated, hematitic jasperoid. The jasperoids of ‘Montaña de Manganeso’ occur mainly as replacements of limestone, sandstone and shale, commonly nearby high-angle fault systems. The mineralogy of the jasperoids consist of quartz and its polymorphs (chalcedony, tridymite and cristobalite), Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, calcite and minor barite. Many outcrops show evidence of several periods of brecciation and silicification. The geochemical signature of the jasperoids suggests that silicification was product of hydrothermal activity. The jasperoids display enrichment in elements of hydrothermal provenance such as Ba, Sr, As, Cr, Mo, Sb, Ni, Zn and Cu, whereas are strongly depleted in the elements indicative of clastic sources such as Ti, K, Th and Zr. Element ratios such as (Fe+Mn)/Ti, Al/(Al+Fe+Mn), Fe/Mn and U /Th, along with the Al-Fe-Mn and Fe-Mn-(Ni+Co+Cu)×10 ternary diagrams confirm a hydrothermal origin. Low ∑REE, an enrichment of LREE over HREE, negative Ce anomalies and positive Y anomalies (YPASS/HoPAAS) also support the hydrothermal processes. The geological evidence, in the form of a feeder zone and extensive hydrothermal alteration, show that the silica forming the rocks originated from ascending hot fluids.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1651/1439

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Silicic magmas in the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field: an overview about plumbing systems, crustal storage and genesis processes","The origin of silicic rocks in the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field (MGVF) has been understudied since the volcanic field attracted the attention of researchers. Using geochemical, petrological and structural data from the literature, here we propose a model for the origin of silicic magmas. We found that all volcanic rocks known to date in the MGVF can be divided in 40 % andesite, 33 % basaltic andesite, 15 % basalt, 2 % trachybasalt to trachyandesite, and 10 % dacite-rhyolite. The structural systems that deformed the crust in the MGVF are NNW-SSE-oriented normal faults of the Taxco-San Miguel de Allende fault system, developed during the Oligocene, and the Morelia-Acambay fault system consisting of ENE-SSW to E-W sinistral strike-slip faults developed during the Oligocene-Miocene. In addition to bibliographic data, we present a gravimetric-magnetometric model to investigate the characteristics of the local basement where magmas acquire their final silicic composition, and a seismic tomography model to investigate the deep plumbing system that contribute to form the silicic rocks emplaced on the surface. The only report of assimilation experiments we found in the MGVF literature suggest that plagioclase and pyroxene are more easily digested than quartz by hotter magmas. The digestion of these mineral phases has a direct consequence on the generation of dacites and rhyolites. We propose that regardless of the genesis of andesitic melts, such intermediate magmas arrive to the upper-crust and are forced to evolve within local compression zones where they melt the local granitic basement and form crystal mushes. The compositional variability of silicic rocks in the MGVF is a consequence of the variable mixing between the intermediate magmas and the granitic partial melts.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1668/1434

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Brittle deformation in Miocene rocks of the Morelia-Cuitzeo region, Michoacán: implications on the local geothermal system","Brittle deformation is accommodated by faults and fractures, which affect the upper crust of the Earth. The distribution of brittle deformation and the arrangement of faults and fractures are little known variables, although they influence the rock permeability and are important to understand the strain concentration. Our work explores the strain distribution and the fault arrangement on Miocene andesitic rocks in the Morelia-Cuitzeo area through a quantitative strain analysis at the mesoscopic scale. Two fracture families (F1 and F2) affect the rocks in the study area, and they are related to two brittle deformation events (D1 and D2) occurred between the Miocene and the Recent. The F1 fractures have an NNW-SSE strike and accommodate ~2.5 % of a ENE-WSW extension. The F2 fractures cut the F1 fractures, have an ENE-WSW strike, and accommodate ~7 % of a ~N-S extension. Both facture families have an arrangement of fracture clusters and average fracture intensity of 17 fractures/meter. The fracture intensity behavior is related to the rock type and not to the amount of strain. The finite strain (extension) of the F1 and F2 fractures has a heterogeneous distribution. This behavior contributes significantly to secondary porosity associated with F1 and F2 fractures. The strain distribution, and the quantity and arrangement of the fractures suggest that the Miocene rocks may be the permeable package of a geothermal system in the Cuitzeo Lake area.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1669/1436
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geological, geomorphological, and geophysical evidence associated with the Cerritos fault, and implications for seismic hazard in Morelia, Michoacán, México","The Cerritos fault is located SW of Morelia city, in the state of Michoacán, Mexico. The fault belongs to the western part of the Morelia-Acambay Fault System, an area with several active segmented faults that form various grabens and half-grabens. In this area, faulting affects Miocene to Holocene lithologies; some of these faults even control the distribution of regional monogenetic volcanoes. This work is an interdisciplinary approach to characterize the Cerritos fault, an important structure with a high seismic hazard potential. The Cerritos fault is a 12 km-long oblique fault (normal-left lateral) with a 130±5 m-high topographic relief (100 m of surface displacement + 30 m of subsurface displacement estimated from the inverted resistivity study). This fault is ENE-WSW oriented (255°), with a 76° NNW dip. In a well-exposed cross section of the Cerritos fault, a few meters from the master fault trace, a colluvial wedge with organic material was identified, yielding a radiocarbon age of 3.37–3.21 cal ka BP. Our geologic and geomorphological analyses indicate that the Cerritos fault is a young, tectonically-active fault, especially in its eastern part. The vertical and horizontal linearity of the fault scarp and the accumulation of lake deposits in the down-thrown block suggest active vertical motion (uplift and subsidence, respectively) along this fault. Geophysical surveys, including seismic refraction, terrestrial magnetometry, and electrical resistivity tomography, show the subsurface geometry of the fault to be characterized by a main listric fault plane and a damage zone in the footwall block, extending as far as 75 m from the main scarp. The damage zone is characterized by secondary, synthetic, and antithetic faults, forming roll-over anticlines and two crestal collapse grabens that accumulate colluvial material. Paleoseismic estimates of activity and seismic hazard potential indicate that the Cerritos fault has a slip-rate of 0.03±0.01 mm/yr, with mean vertical displacements of 0.5 m per event and a mean recurrence interval of 16700 years. The Cerritos fault can generate single-segment ruptures with magnitudes ofMw6.2 to 6.6. Still, in a worst-case scenario, it could also rupture with the subparallel and adjacent Morelia and Cointzio faults, generating earthquake magnitudes up toMw6.9.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1670/1437
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Review of paleomagnetic data from lava flows associated with the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field: implications on the behavior of the Earth’s magnetic field during the Plio-Quaternary,"The great availability of radiometric ages for the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field allows obtaining a detailed record of the Earth's magnetic field variations during the last 5 Ma. In this work, we analyze 112 reliable paleomagnetic directions supported by the same number of absolute ages. After discarding the transitional geomagnetic polarities, following the criterion of paleolatitudes less than 45°, the global mean paleomagnetic directions were calculated. In general terms, it is observed that the mean direction agrees, within the uncertainty interval, with the expected paleomagnetic directions obtained according to the Pliocene-Quaternary reference poles. The secular variation rate, estimated through the dispersion of the calculated virtual geomagnetic poles, and the inclination anomaly coincide with the latitudinal distribution models reported for the latitude of 20° N. An interesting finding, resulting from this compilation of paleomagnetic directions, is the possible evidence of relatively short geomagnetic events or excursions within the Matuyama and Brunhes chrones, which may help to refine the geomagnetic instability time scale. Besides, an unpublished compilation and a detailed description of more than 1000 volcanic buildings by Dr. Víctor Hugo Garduño Monroy are presented, which will undoubtedly serve as an authentic guide for paleomagnetic studies during the following decades.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1671/1428

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Physical-mechanical behavior of fresh and completely altered rocks as an important factor of slope instability in the El Rosario Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary, Michoacán, Mexico","Slope instability in the Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (RBMM) Michoacán, Mexico, is a widespread phenomenon that results from the complex interaction among different factors such as climate, slope, and the spatial distribution of different rock units. The climate is temperate subhumid, with rains in summer and an annual average rainfall of 700 to 1250 mm. The main physiographic units of the area are volcanic mountains, with slopes greater than 30 degrees. The main scope of this study is to characterize the physical-mechanical properties of fresh and completely altered lower Miocene andesitic lavas of the Sierra de Angangueo (Cerro El Campanario, province of El Rosario, Michoacán) by implementing laboratory tests (bulk density, permeability, porosity, uniaxial compressive strength). The fresh rock sample presents total porosity, permeability, and UCS values of 0.262 mD, 17.1 %, and 63.5 MPa, respectively. Instead, the altered rock display values of 393.71 mD, 60.9 %, and 0.26 MPa. Our results suggest that the slope and the degradation of the rock properties induced by alteration are the conditioning factors of instability in the region. Atypical rainfalls may act as triggering mechanism for slope failure.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1674/1441
