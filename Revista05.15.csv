Actually, the experimental system is working at Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas y Acuícolas de Cuemanco (CIBAC), with low concentration of organics (under 300 COD), solely. The first two reactors –of the three which operates in series as anaerobic system- they remove about 70 percent of organic matter. On the other hand, the aerobic reactor –wet packed tower- it’s operate at countercurrent with the air, flowing by natural convection. This reactor can remove organic matter about 50 % of the feed. With the redesign and its study of the pilot plant, this technology aims to treat and recirculate, as far as possible, the used water into the CIBAC, and with itself, to get savings in the drinking water consumption.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2017/1045

The investment mold cavity walls were coated with hydroxyapatite powder before casting. Selected cast samples were subjected to a heat treatment at 1220°C for 1 hr and then water quenched. In order to evaluate the bioactivity, the cast samples were immersed in simulated body fluid, SBF, for 21 days at 37°C. The surface of the samples were characterized by SEM, XRD and EDS. Surface analysis of the metallic samples after casting showed a appreciable amount of embedded ceramic particles.

In the analysis of drying curves is applied the concept of Reduced Drying Rate (Vr). Is assumed that material properties depends exclusively on reduced moisture content variation (Xr), using a moving central average. Slices of Banana are dehydrated in a longitudinal flow drying tunnel at 60°C without pre-heating, with a Relative Humidity of 10-25% and three airflows velocities (1 m/s, 2 m/s, 3 m/s). The method for the analysis of drying curves, it allows identifier four drying phases: increasing drying rate (phase 1), exponentially falling drying rate (phase 2), quasi-linear falling drying rate (phase 3) and a final falling drying rate (phase 4), putting in evidence the constant drying rate apparition. The reduced drying rate facilitates the analysis of drying processes at product scale, since the drying of hygroscopical media is a complex process of moisture displacement, difficult to describe, mainly when the process is applied to bio-fibrous materials like fruits",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2028/1050

There is also experimental evidence that, only molecules bigger than those of methane, might occupy cavities in hydrates with type II structure. In this work we make use of molecular dynamics to explore the existence of type II methane hydrates. The temperature was set to 298 K and the degree of cavity occupancy was varied from 50% to 100%. The calculations include radial distribution functions (RDF), velocity autocorrelation functions (VACF), mean square atom displacement (MSD), the total potential energy and the pressure of the system. According to the results from molecular simulation we concluded that, at the simulated temperature, occupation larger than 95 % in the small cavities is required to assure the existence of type II structure methane hydrates",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2030/1053

Freeze- drying is then without doubt, the best option to dry such sensitive and delicate food, allowing the avocado to preserve all its sensorial and nutritional characteristics. This project studies the behavior of freeze-dried avocado when rehydrated, performing capacity and kinetics tests of re-hydration. Two immersion bath temperatures were used, 25ºC and 45ºC. Observations showed that at higher immersion bath temperatures the structure of the avocado may be damaged, and there was no clear tendency shown with longer freezing times. Regarding the freeze-dry temperature the avocado tends to re-hydrate better at lower freezing temperatures. The re-hydration coefficient reaches and exceeds the unit value, which would imply that through this process the avocado reaches a complete re-hydration. The results show that at an immersion bath temperature of 25ºC and longer freezing times the rehydration is faster and more complete; whereas at an immersion bath temperature of 45ºC, no clear tendency exists. At freezing periods longer than 10 hours, the structure of the avocado becomes weak, causing the product to disintegrate during re- hydration.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2036/1056

The pilot plant level model includes partial differential equations for the balances of matter, energy and moment and empirical correlations for evaluating properties and transport variables. The scaling was done based on the drying process characteristic dimensionless groups. Design variables (dryer length and diameter) were expressed as a function of those groups and balance equations were simplified to ordinary differential equations because the variation of moisture and temperature inside the particles was less than 0.5 %. The industrial scale simulation model was validated with data reported in the literature and it was used for generating information about relationships among process variables. With the results of the simulations, two correlations were developed for calculating length and diameter of industrial dryers as function of operation variables and initial moisture content of particles. The maximum percentage error generated by the correlations was of 13.6% and 7.2 as average",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2037/1057

In order to predict the dispersed phase deformation an experimental setup was designed to measure the stretching force. The results show that both draw ratio and water contact distance have a definite influence on the final dimensions of the ribbon and its morphology. Furthermore, it was observed that the impact failure energy is strongly related to the final blend morphology. Numerical simulations of the non-isothermal process using Matlab 6.1 were in good agreement with the experimental data only when both viscous and elastic effects are included.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2038/1058

Moreover, this plant has been proposed as a potential Cd hyperaccumulator. In order to obtain a more complete profile for metal accumulation and tolerance, experiments were conducted in agar media individually contaminated with 0-40 mg L−1of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II). Zn was rather beneficial as it promoted root and shoot elongation as well as biomass accumulation. Plants exposed to Cu accumulated 1300 mg kg−1dry weight in the aerial plant part, indicating a potential hyperaccumulation. X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) studies showed that tumbleweed plants absorb and move Zn and Ni from the roots to the leaves without changes in oxidation state and coordination environment; however, Cu is transported to the aerial part probably bound to different compounds in different plant tissues. Oxygen/nitrogen were identified as ligands for Zn; Cu was observed complexed to sulfur and oxygen, while Ni was bound to nitrogen/oxygen. The results obtained in this research indicate that S. kali can be considered as an option to cleanup polluted soils containing moderate amounts of Cu, Ni, and Zn.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2041/1060

Acooling network is part of a global system that consists of a cooling tower, a heat exchanger network and a pumping system. Most industrial installations have cooling systems whose network of exchangers are arranged in parallel, which indicates that the supply water reaches every unit at the same temperature. However, since not all exchangers require water at the same temperature, it is possible to generate different arrangements with positive results in terms of the equipment size and capital investment. Various heat exchanger network arrangements are analysed subject to restrictions such as the maximum permissible water return temperature and the allowable pressure drop between the supply and return points of the system. Results indicate that the series arrangement utilizes in a more efficient way the temperature driving forces and the pressure drop resulting in lower overall heat transfer area and lower investment cost.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2044/1061

Rigorous simulations were conducted by using Aspen Plus™ RATEFRAC Module for the separation of ternary mixtures. According to the equilibrium model, the energy-efficient design of the Petlyuk column requires that the intermediate component be extracted from the maximum point in the composition profile of the intermediate component in the main column. It was found that, for the intermediate component, mass transfer occurs from the vapour to the liquid phase from the top of the column to the stage where the sidestream is extracted, from this point mass transfer occurs in the opposite direction. This point, considering the nonequilibrium model, corresponds to the stage in which the net mass transfer rate is zero. For the case of two segments per stage, it was found that the heat duties predicted by the equilibrium model are significantly lower than those obtained by using the nonequilibrium model, which is consistent with previous reported results. However, it is important to say that despite of the higher energy duty predicted by the nonequilibrium model, both models predict significant energy savings.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2045/1062

The problem solution assumed negligible vapor holdup in the column, constant liquid in a stages and in the condenser system, constant steam flow, adiabatic column, total condenser and amount derived from well-known reflux. The analysis has been made considering that leaves from the reflux can be back feed to one or more plates, as well as in the reboiler. Also it has been considered which the derivation at any moment is an expressed well-known amount like the relation of flow that is derived towards the stages and the one that is turned back by the dome of the column.

These reactive systems have been studied as ternary in terms of element even though comprise four components. The amount of element keeps constant and independent of the type of reaction then, element balance equations lack of reaction term and look like molar balances without reaction. As a result, reactive residue curve maps could be created and classical design methods like Lewis-Matheson could be carried out as in distillation without reaction. Based on this, a fundamental design is worked out as a starting point towards further sophisticated designs",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2047/1065

This characteristic has allowed the application of standard nonlinear-programming methods to the design of conventional distillation columns. In this work, collocation techniques are applied to design Petlyuk distillation columns for the separation of ternary mixtures. Using the preliminary design generated by a shortcut method, collocation techniques were applied to refine the values for interconnecting and sidestream product stages as well as the interlinking flows that provide specified product purities. The proposed method gives a proper distribution of stages for the Petlyuk system, as shown in two cases of study. The final designs are easily obtained by means of the proposed methodology, with a significant lower effort than that required when preliminary designs are corrected using recursive simulations.

The design is developed beginning with a problem definition in terms of the element concept that, in our case, changes the representation from three component system to binary mixture (elements A and B). As a consequence, graphical design techniques such as McCabe- Thiele and Ponchon-Savarit proposed originally for distillation without reaction, have been performed. Based on these procedures, a fundamental design (all stages are reactive and in equilibrium) is obtained that allows to know equipment size and reactive/non-reactive zone location. Entering a pertinent kinetic model a design controlled by reaction kinetics is achieved. By simple strategies and using a commercial simulator, an optimum hybrid design is built (reactive stages and non-reactive stages).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2049/1067

In this paper the ethyl acetate process is studied, using distillation systems with side columns (either stripper or rectifier) to carry out the reaction-separation. Thermally coupled sequence with side stripper shows more advantages because it reduces traditional process energy demand and also eliminates the water produced by the chemical reaction which allows higher ethyl acetate production and avoid azeotrope formation.

Since the equilibrium amount of paraxylene at the outlet of the catalytic reformer is only ∼24 %, a separation of this isomer is performed, and the orthoand meta- rich fraction is selectively isomerized. The reaction system is highly complex and besides isomerization, hydrogenolysis, disproportionation, trans-alkylation and hydrocracking might also occur during the reaction. In the past, a Pt/silica-alumina catalyst was used in the industrial reactor for this process, however lately zeolitic catalysts have gained importance due to their better activity and selectivity. In this work, the catalytic behavior (selectivity) of Pt/Mordenita and Pt/SiO2-Al2O3commercial catalysts in the hydroconversion of C8aromatics was analyzed through a mathematical reaction model. A pseudo-heterogeneous one-dimensional model was used to represent the behavior of the reactor. The proposed model represents well the product distribution and outlet temperature of the industrial reactor. The results of the parametric sensitivity analysis indicated that temperature, pressure and space velocity were the most influential variables for the yield of para-xylene, while for the loss of xylenes, pressure and space velocity were more important than temperature. Intermediate values of temperature (377-427 °C), pressure (10-15 atm) and W/Fo (5-10 kgcat/kgmol/h) favored the para-xylene yield and decreased the loss of xylenes",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2056/1072

Before this water can be disposed, Cr(VI) must be removed according with the limit established by the Mexican environmental regulations. Due to the low amounts of sludge and the low operative costs, the electrochemical treatment has shown important qualities as an alternative of the conventional processes. In order to find technologic options based in this kind of process, in this work the bases of a numerical model to scale an industrial tubular electrochemical reactor are presented. According with experimental results the hypothesis that motivates this study is proposed. This premise consider possible to reproduce the reactor behavior using an uncoupled model. This is an important model structure simplification that allows evaluating the reactor behavior solving the advection-diffusion equation in a stationary three-dimensional hydrodynamic field, which is calculated from the Navier-Stokes equations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2057/1073

In this work, we present a rheological study of micellar solutions, formed by CTAT in presence of three different types of counterions [e.g. potassium bromide (KBr), sodium oxalate (COONa)2, and potassium phosphate (K3PO4)]. From experimental results of CTAT micellar solutions at different concentration, it is proposed critical electrolyte concentration vs. CTAT concentration diagram that facilitates the identification of the critical conditions for having a rheological transition from shear thickening to thinning behavior",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,

The purpose of this research is to detect faults using multivariate statistical techniques; specifically singular value decomposition (SVD). The analyzed data base comes from a real polyester film process. The original data base captured by the monitoring system has 4928 samples and 308 variables. Three analysis are made; the first one analysis is made using two data bases separately, the second one analysis is made dividing the process in seven sections and finally the analysis is made using all the information in just one data base. It was found that the detection is better when the whole information from the plant is used in just one data block.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2070/1074

Two case studies are described using dynamic data from a distillation column and an Industrial Polymerization plant. The purpose of proposed wavelet scheme is to construct on-line dynamic models. In both case studies, it is made a comparison between the wavelet model and a lineal difference equation model. Finally on the base of comparison a conclusion is made based in the better response, which may be helpful to create an estimated on-line internal model control and its application to model-predictive controllers.
