Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Mercury anomalies and transport mechanisms in a hydrothermal system associated with normal faults in Araró, Michoacán (western Mexico)","In this paper, we infer a mechanism for Hg transport and mobility in the Araró-Simirao geothermal system, which is associated with a normal fault system of general NE-SW orientation, through the hydrogeochemical modeling of Hg in water and soils and their relationship with the Hg concentration in the air. A sampling of thermal water and soils was carried out, and it was compared with gaseous elemental Hg emissions. The predominant Hg species in water are Hg0(aq), HgCl2and HgCl3-, although the Hg0(aq)abundance is lower with respect to Hg2+. Hydrothermal alteration minerals such as barite and particles with Hg contents were found in the soil. In general, are inferred the geochemical processes involved in the Hg transport between the environmental compartments, water, soil, and atmosphere are volatilization, oxidation, complexation, and deposition. The deep hydrothermal system favors the transport of elemental gaseous mercury, of probable magmatic origin, to the surface through the areas with the highest permeability, such as the Araró-Simirao fault. In its ascent, the hydrothermal fluids interact with the subsurface aquifer, enriching the aquifer in Hg and forming chlorinated complexes that are transported in the aqueous medium. When thermal water enriched in Hg is discharged to the surface, the mercury volatilizes as Hg0(g)and remains in the atmosphere or can be deposited on the soils surrounding the springs, adhering to particles of organic matter or clays, and forming aureoles of Hg anomalies on the surface. According to the spatial distribution of the anomalies, the area closest to geothermal fluids (vertical rise of gases) is the southern part of the system.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1596/1424
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Preface,"In October 2019, the national and international Earth Science community lost a pillar with the unfortunate death of Dr Victor Hugo Garduño Monroy. Victor Hugo was not only known for his contribution to the knowledge of the tectonics of Mexico and to the understanding of geological research in oil and geothermics, he also spurred pioneering studies in paleoseismology in this country; additionally, he worked on the geological-environmental interpretation of pre-Columbian glyphs, his latest passion. He achieved the resolution of various hypotheses, creating truths that, through his approach, became evidence, thereby establishing landmarks in frontier research in the diverse applications of structural geology. In the course of his trailblazing academic career, Victor Hugo changed the lives of many researchers and students, many of whom felt stimulated by his essence, his sympathy, and his contagious positivity. The main outdoor laboratory was his native land Michoacán, where the scientific community admired his talents to “communicate with the earth”. In Michoacán, Victor Hugo dedicated many years to the study of volcanoes, and coined his famous sentence: “The earth and the volcanoes belong to those who work with them”. Because of his multiple talents and contributions, the Victor Hugo we once knew will not easily be forgotten.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1648/1423
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Las Cabras volcano, Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field, México: Topographic, climatic, and shallow magmatic controls on scoria cone eruptions","Scoria cones are abundant in most volcanic fields on Earth, such as the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field, in the central-western sector of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. However, there are few in-depth studies on their eruptive style and controlling factors, despite of their diversity in shape and composition which implies a wide range of hazards. Here, we present results of morphologic, stratigraphic, sedimentary, petrographic, and geochemical studies of the prominent Las Cabras scoria cone located west of the Zacapu lacustrine basin in the center of the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field. This basaltic andesitic to andesitic volcano formed between 27 and 26 kyrs BP on the steep slopes (>10º) of the lava shield of El Tule volcano. Over time, its dominant eruptive style changed from Strombolian to effusive. Initial explosive activity built a 170-m-high scoria cone and deposited thick tephra fallout on the surrounding sloping terrain. Structures in the deposits indicate that early friable fine-grained tephra underwent significant erosion due to syn-eruptive heavy rain coupled with the sloping nature of the underlying ground. This erosion generated lahars that very likely reached the Zacapu lake based on the pre-eruptive topography. As the explosivity dropped, lava was emitted from the base of the cone first to the S and SE, forming a thick, viscous lobe that filled a pre-existing E-W valley. The flow direction then deviated to the N and NE, to form thinner, less-viscous lobes fed from the vent by an open-channel. The lavas are covered by hummocks made of agglutinates and bombs that indicate that the eruption terminated by catastrophic collapse of the SE sector of the cone, possibly triggered by the intrusion of magma within the cone, which destabilized its downslope segment. The sudden flank failure was potentially associated with a late effusive event and the hummocks may have been carried away by the lava surge. Whole-rock chemical variations and crystal disequilibrium textures point toward a complex magma feeding system, involving mixing and mingling between different magma batches. This study shows that the formation of scoria cones on a terrain with a marked slope (>10°) has profound impacts on the eruption dynamics and related hazards due to its effect on cone stability and ash erosion. It also evidences the erosive effect of syn-eruptive rain on fine-grained tephra, especially when deposited on a slope. Finally, it reveals the complex magmatic processes that may occur in the shallow plumbing system of monogenetic andesitic volcanoes, which could be particularly important in inland areas of continental arcs.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1645/1425
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geochemical and petrographic characteristics and magmatic evolution ofthe Los Azufres Volcanic Field, Michoacán, during the Pleistocene","Los Azufres Volcanic Field hosts the second most important geothermal field in Mexico. Volcanic activity in this field began some 1.57 Ma and lasted until < 26 ka, with the emission of different volcanic products with compositions varying from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. The volcanic products generated by this chemically heterogeneous activity are lava plateaus, domes, and stratovolcanoes, many of them with pyroclastic deposits associated. All these rocks were grouped into four different units: Basaltic-Andesite, Andesitic, Dacitic and Rhyolitic. The rhyolitic products are the most abundant with ages ranging from 1.5 Ma to <26ka, whereas the mafic units vary from 1.5 to 0.33 Ma. The mineralogy observed in the different units is consistent with their chemical composition, the Basaltic-Andesite Unit contains ol+plg+opx+cpx and oxides, while the Andesitic Unit contains plg+opx+oxides, the Dacitic Unit contains plg+opx+cpx+anf+bt and oxides, as well as traces of quartz and zircon, whereas the Rhyolitic Unit contains qz+sanidine+plg+bt+anf and oxides. In general, the major element concentrations of all the analyzed samples display clear evolutive trends, which suggest a genetic relationship, with a break in slope configured by the geochemical data at approximately 64 wt. % SiO2for most elements that can be related to the fractionation of mafic mineral phases. Regarding trace elements, there is an enrichment in incompatible and light rare earth elements, with pronounced positive anomalies in Pb, U and K and negative in Nb, Ta, and Ti, in addition to a variable negative Eu anomaly depending on the chemical composition. According to our petrogenetic model generated in this work, the main evolutive mechanism responsible for the magmatic diversity in the CVLA was the assimilation of crustal rocks, with composition like that of La Huacana intrusive rocks, coupled with fractional crystallization (AFC). The results show an assimilated mass/crystallized mass ratio of 0.5, crystallizing 54 % of the magma, assuming the fractionation of 5 % olivine, 10 % clinopyroxene, 10 % orthopyroxene, 20 % plagioclase, 5 % amphibole and 5 % magnetite. To a lesser extent, assimilation without fractional crystallization also played a role in the magmatic evolution, although the model does not explain the generation of most rhyolitic magmas in the area, which were most likely derived by a different mechanism not discussed here.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1646/1427

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Comment on “Emplazamiento del magmatismo Paleoceno-Eoceno bajo un régimen transtensional y su evolución a un equilibrio dinámico en el borde occidental de Colombia” by Grajales et al., Rev. Mex. Cienc. Geol. (2020), 37(3), 250-268","Grajaleset al.(2020) reviewed geochronological and geochemical data from Paleogene volcanic and plutonic rocks outcropping in the Panama-Choco Block (north western Cordillera) and southern Western Cordillera, as well as the Central Cordillera of Colombia. These data were used to support a model of continuous Paleogene arc magmatism along the Colombian continental margin, and to propose a paleogeographic model for the arc. The authors did not discuss previously published paleomagnetic, geochemical, geochronological, thermochronological and provenance constraints from Cretaceous to Miocene rocks of western and northern Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador that support a more plausible model of a double subduction system controlled by the convergence of the Caribbean and Farallon plates beneath the north Andean block during Paleogene. In this comment, we discuss shortcomings in the data and model proposed by Grajaleset al.(2020) and present an alternative interpretation for contemporaneous arc-like magmatism during the Paleogene in the Northern Andes. We conclude that the double subduction system is the more plausible explanation for the contemporaneous arc-like magmatism during the Paleogene, currently exposed in the northern and southern portions of the Northern Andes.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1615/1420
