Recombinant production of MRJP1 represents an alternative to direct extraction from royal jelly. Production inPichia pastorisresults in high density biomass, with a supernatant containing high amount of impurities. Various methods have been applied to recover and/or purify MRJP1. Here, exploiting the physicochemical properties of MRJP1, reverse phase chromatography (RPC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) were investigated as alternative methods to recover MRJP1 directly from supernatant. All techniques showed a 57-kDa band in SDS-PAGE analysis, corresponding to the size of recombinant MRJP1, with contaminants attributed to culture media. However, SEC coupled to IEX evidenced a single peak in the chromatogram corresponding to MRJP1 which suggest it may be a good protocol to recover recombinant MRJP1 fromP. pastorissupernatant. This approach serves as a procedure to identify MRJP1 in fermentation culture ofP. pastoris. This is the first report about characterization of IEX-based recovery of recombinantApis melliferaMRJP1 produced inPichia pastoriswithout the use of histidine tags.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1713/1006

The current need is to find alternative ways of curing diseases led by these pathogens. In this context the current study was steered towards finding the potential of extracellularly synthesized biogenic bismuth nanoparticles BiNPs in combination with biogenic silver nanoparticles AgNPs and doxycycline hydrochloride against multidrug resistant pathogens. MIC value for BiNPs was 6 and 10mg/l and for biogenic AgNPs it was 16 and 18ug/l againstSalmonella typhiBTCB06 andStaphylococcus aureusBTCB02, respectively. Whereas combination of BiNPs and doxycycline MIC was 3 and 5mg/l and for BiNPs and AgNPs it was 8 and 9ug/l forS. typhiandS. aureus,respectively. FICI value for the combination of BiNPs and Doxycycline was 0.75 againstSalmonella typhiandStaphylococcus aureus, respectively. However the combination of AgNPs and BiNPs had FICI value 1 against both the test strains. Bismuth nanoparticles and doxycycline showed synergistic effect against both pathogens. BiNPs and AgNPs showed additive effect against both pathogens.

However, the effect of VHb on animal cells has been scarcely studied. To gain insight about the impact of VHb on aerobic energy metabolism and recombinant protein expression, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were obtained and transfected for VHb expression. GFP expression slightly increased, whereas cell viability and the mitochondrial membrane potential were not affected by VHb expression. In contrast, the NAD+/NADH ratio and ATP cell content tended to decrease, while the NADP+/NADPH ratio increased as a consequence of VHb presence. These results suggest that VHb can improve recombinant protein expression in CHO cells by altering the energy metabolism. This can be useful for the design of robust cell factories for industrial applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1866/1083

This residues presents an interesting opportunity for obtaining value-added products, mainly due to its composition, formed principally by water, soluble sugars, fiber, organic acids, fatty acids, minerals, essential oils, flavonoids, and vitamins. Despite this, the valorisation of this residual biomass has been almost completely ignored. In this paper, the residual peel was analyzed in order to determine its biotechnological potential, for this, different oil extraction methods were compared, the fatty acids profile was determined, also characterization and the antioxidant potential of the defatted residues were evaluated. The results showed that the principal fatty acids present in the oil extracted were Palmitic, Oleic and Linoleic, which allows its use for food and bioenergy purposes, moreover, the defatted residual biomass characterization presents a chemical composition which allows the use for as livestock, biogas production or agronomy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antioxidant activity from defatted Persian lime residual biomass, wherein, the residues generated by steam distillation showed the bigger amount of phenolic compounds, but the obtained from hexane extraction presents a higher antioxidant activity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1935/1137

In this work, the expression of a synthetic codon-optimized gene of human interleukin-2 inE. coliBL21-SI, carrying plasmid pET12a-hIL2 is presented. Glucose, fructose or Agave syrup fromAgave salmiana,were used as carbon sources for production of recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) in 1.5-L bioreactor aerobic cultures using mineral medium. Codon optimization of the nativehIL-2gene eliminated the presence of 35 rare codons forE. coli, and improved the codon usage up to 76% compared with the native gene sequence. Cultures using 10 g/L glucose showed the lowest production of rhIL-2, and in contrast, cultures using fructose improved the production of rhIL-2 1.9-times. The utilization of fructose from Agave syrup enhanced the rhIL-2 production 3.9-times, reaching 103.42±6.61 mgIL-2/L. The specific rhIL-2 production rate (5.52±0.33 mgIL-2/gDCW·h) using Agave syrup was also the highest. These results indicate that Agave syrup stimulates the production of rhIL-2 and it is an inexpensive alternative carbon source. This research abilities the potential use the Agaves to produce alternative and valuable biotechnological products instead the alcoholic beverages.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2004/1167

Then, it is essential to design production processes for this type of microorganisms, which are optimal from the point of view of production time and cost. This paper presents a study of the effect of using a low-cost culture medium, formulated with beet molasses, which manages to enhance the growth of two types of probiotic microorganisms,Saccharomyces boulardii,andLactobacillus plantarum. In addition to its effect on cellular biomass growth, a kinetic model for both strains growth is also presented. This model includes factors such as theS. boulardiicapability to hydrolyze saccharose into their respective monosaccharides and the inhibition effect of lactic acid production onL. plantarumgrowth.

To assess antioxidant, antiglycation, enzyme inhibitory, antiamnestic, cytotoxic, thrombolytic, antibiofilm potentials in roots of threePanax ginsengpreparations (red, black, white), powdered material was extracted and fractionated into different solvents. Antioxidant activity, phenolic and flavonoids contents were assessed by using free radical scavenging, Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and aluminum chloride colorimetric assays. Antiglycation and enzyme (alpha amylase, alpha glucosidase and acetylcholinesterse) inhibition activities were tested by prescribed methods along with cytotoxic (antihemolytic profile), thrombolytic activity, and biofilm growth inhibition assays. Red and black ginseng indicated maximum phenolic contents (37.26 ± 1.563 g GAE) and flavonoid contents (149.4 ± 2.032 g CE) respectively. The DPPH scavenging ability (62.84%) of red ginseng was higher than black and white ginseng. Significant antidiabetic activities were exhibited by black and white ginseng.

Such diversity can result that fermented cocoa quality is not always the same. The use of microbial consortia can steer the process, allowing the production of fermented cocoa beans with homogeneous quality and safety. For that reason, it was proposed to use indigenous microorganisms to formulate defined inoculums to conduct the small- fermentation of Mexican cocoa. A total of 54 strains were isolated from the spontaneous fermentation of cocoa. These included yeasts (Candida,Rhodotorula,SaccharomycesandYarrowia), LAB (LactobacillusandLactococcus), and AAB (AcetobacterandGluconobacter). The cocoa fermentations were inoculated with an inoculum composed of lipolyticYarrowia,Lactococcus lactis, andAcetobacter aceti, only varying the form of inoculation (mixed or microbial succession) and were compared with spontaneous fermentation. It was observed that fermentation conducted by succession inoculation form showed similar behavior to the spontaneous process, obtaining well-fermented cocoa beans with homogeneous quality and safety.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1869/1054

In this research, bilayer materials were developed using TPS monolayers assembled with monolayers sheets of amorphous polylactic acid (PLAa) and polycaprolactone (PCL). Potassium sorbate was evaluated as an interfacial adhesion material. Structural properties of the laminated materials (FTIR and SEM), behaviour with water (rate of water vapour transmission, solubility in water and moisture content) and biodegradation of the materials were evaluated. Physical and chemical interactions between the studied monolayers by the addition of potassium sorbate were found. The use of monolayer sheets of PLAaand PCL overcomes the disadvantages of the materials obtained from starch. A practical alternative was developed to obtain materials with better properties.

For this reason, the removal of metals from effluents before their discharge into the receiving water bodies is of crucial importance. This is why, in the present investigation, the biosorption processes of Cd (II) and Pb (II) inPhaseolus vulgaris L.(bean) agricultural residues (stems, leaves and leaf sheaths) were optimized. The influence of pH, biosorbent doses and initial concentration levels of metallic ions was evaluated using the response surface methodology (RSM). Quadratic models were developed for the percent removal of Cd (II) and Pb (II). Optimal biosorption conditions were attained at pH = 4.3, a 7.4 g/L biosorbent dose and an initial 9.14 mg/L concentration of each metal, achieving percent removals of 87.70 and 95.58% for Cd (II) and Pb (II), respectively. The FT-IR characterization showed that the functional groups involved in adsorption would be in the range of 2300 to 2400 cm-1.

The management of the electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is a necessary and interesting task due to the possible recovery of its elevated metallic content (Zn, Pb, Cu, etc.). This reduces the environmental pollution generated by the leachability of its heavy metals and produces new revenues for the steel industries. In this work, a hydrometallurgical route was studied to extract the zinc present in EAFD.  The research carried out using two carboxylic acids: sodium citrate and oxalic acid at moderate concentrations (≤ 0.5 M). The effect of pH, molar concentration and stirring speed was analyzed. Under pressure and ambient temperature, after 3 h of leaching, the results showed that both agents can leach zinc from waste, reaching metal extractions of approximately 50%. The more stable franklinite (ZnFe2O4) and hematite (Fe2O3) phases were not decomposed under these mild conditions. Citrate was especially promising due to its selectivity for zinc.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2022/1143

However, there are others that have not yet been recognized as emerging organic pollutants because the damage that could be caused to the environment, especially in the water, is still unknown. For example, it is interesting to pay attention on Splenda because is increasingly consumed worldwide today. Splenda is one of the emerging pollutants that has not yet been formally declared as a pollutant, but there are some findings that show Splenda as a water pollutant, specifically the sucralose molecule, due to persistence in the environment. In this work, the mineralization of Splenda, in different initial concentrations (72 mg l-1, 144 mg l-1and 288 mg l-1), was carried out by TiO2photocatalysis assisted with photo-Fenton. Splenda mineralization is less than 58% by these processes when used separately; however, Splenda was mineralized 62.8% (72 mg l-1), 83.7% (144 mg l-1) and 58.8% (288 mg l-1) by TiO2photocatalysis assisted with photo-Fenton at 2 h, 5 h and 5 h, respectively.

The country's industrial growth has boosted its economic development, increasing the occurrence of high-impact accidents inside and outside chemical plants. The main purpose of this work was to create a database that contained information related to the accidents that occurred in the Mexican chemical industry. For this extensive investigation, it was necessary to obtain information from news, reports and articles related to this topic. In the database, 267 accidents were collected from 1900 until 2019. A statistical analysis showed that Petroleos Mexicanos, PEMEX, is the company with the highest accidents rate, because this company was a monopoly in the Mexican petrochemical industry until 2013. The types of accidents that occurred the most were explosions and fires, 122 and 55 of these reported accidents, respectively. The most frequently reported substances were diesel and gasoline with a 20% of the total accidents, followed by hydrocarbons and their derivatives with 18.7%.

The effect of feed temperature during the DCMD process was also evaluated on performance of two microfiltration membranes (0.5 µm) having different thickness (300 and 250 µm). Results showed more than 100 % increments on water vapor flux by raising feed temperature from 50 to 70oC and feed flow rates up to 7 L·min-1. No significant effect on process performance was determined by raising permeate flow rates in the range tested. Choosing the type and concentration of antiscalants is critical during seawater desalination by DCMD. Performance of this process increased by up to 49.2 % during desalination of real seawater by adding the KMRO S-516 antiscalant designed to disperse iron, silica and calcium carbonate salts. During DCMD no important water vapor flux decay and no increase on conductivity of the distillate was observed by antiscalants’ dosage. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) from the membrane surface after DCMD desalination of seawater treated with the KMRO S-516 antiscalant confirmed the absence of scaling.","A.L.

FESEM showed that higher bacterial colonization and biofilm growth was obtained in the rough surface of chitin with complex structure, compared to that of polycarbonate membrane at different time intervals. Due to its high magnification and resolution, FESEM enabled a more detailed analysis of the biofilm cells, influenced by different structural organisations and morphology.  On the other hand, FTIR analyses revealed the chemical conformation of the substrate and its biofilm state.

Apparently, the layers coatings micro-structure is not significantly altered (the form of the splats) due to the increase in the treatment time, but the distribution of the defects and the exogenous particles (pollutants) presented clear shifts.

According to the results, the inclusion of treated fiber in polymer influenced the melting temperature of the composite incremented it to 165°C, which is attributable to the a-crystal melting; however, the introduction of the untreated fiber interrupts the crystallinity sequence for a-crystallinity and favors the formation of the b-crystals. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that pristine coconut fiber can be an efficient β-nucleating agent when it is used with no alkaline treatment, indicating that its b-nucleating capability is related to the presence of silicon dots on the fiber surface. In terms of mechanical behavior, the untreated fiber composites presented the highest value in storage modulus (4260 MPa) compared to pure polypropylene; and the presence of a higher content of β-crystals in the polymer matrix gave an improvement of 82%.

However, the technology is constrained by the formation of tars and the costs associated to their eradication. However, moisture, an intrinsic part of biomass, and char, a regular product from gasification, can contribute to tar removal via steam reforming. This work presents an analysis, based on numerical simulations, to elaborate a concept where the steam and char released from gasification are used to reform the produced tars. Results indicate that when the amount of moisture in wood biomass is 8% or more, at adequate temperatures (around 1073 K) the produced steam volume meets the necessary criteria for char catalytic tar reforming. On the side of char, calculations indicate that more than double the char necessary to achieve 0.5 seconds residence time in a bed is produced during each run. Moreover, it was found that moisture in biomass leads to increases in the Lower Heating Value of the produced gas and decreases in the tar contents.
