Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Permineralización en restos de dinosaurios preservados en depósitos de desbordamiento de la Formación Bajo Barreal (Cretácico Superior), Patagonia central, Argentina.","The fossil deposit Cañadón Las Horquetas, placed in the centre-south of the Chubut Province, includes the Bajo Barreal Formation of early Cenomanian – late Turonian age. This site presents the greater abundance and diversity of fossil vertebrates in the San Jorge Gulf Basin. The diagenetic processes reported herein represent a little addressed subject in taphonomic studies involving dinosaurs. We present for the first time information on the permineralization processes that affected the dinosaur remains preserved in overflow deposits from the Bajo Barreal Formation, as well as new sedimentological data of the studied unit.Samples from three specimens were studied by chemical analysis, polarization petrographic microscope, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These studies show that all the dinosaurs have had a similar diagenetic history, with the same pattern of mineral replacement. Besides, the similar chemical composition found in the fossils and in the bearing rocks suggest that the enrichment with new elements found in the studied dinosaur remains was due to the direct exchange with the sediments in which they were buried. The now reported diagenetic conditions can be preliminarily extended to the whole lower member of the Bajo Barreal Formation.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/417/427
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Evidencias hidrogeoquímicas e isotópicas sobre el origen del agua subterránea en la cuenca hidrográfica Río Actopan, Estado de Veracruz","Physical-chemical, chemical and isotopic data of spring water, groundwater and river water from the Actopan basin, central Veracruz were analyzed with the purpose of determining the origin and flow of groundwater. Spring water temperature between 9.6 °C and 18.3 °C, and low electrical conductivity (<150 µS/cm) suggest local recharge. Groundwater temperature of 38.2 °C and electrical conductivity of 1542 µS/cm, 48 mg/L of Cl–, y 721 mg/L of SO42– are associated to deep flow and rock-water interaction (limestone, dolomite, gypsum/anhydrite). Concentrations of NO3– > 10 mg/L allow the identification of anthropogenic sources. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope results fit reasonable well with the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL, δ2H = 8 δ18O + 10) indicating that their recharge derives from local precipitation. On the basis of the observed isotope gradient with altitude (Z), (δ18O = -2.1 (Z km) - 5.56), three main groups of groundwater have been identified: 1) Evaporated water related to the precipitation in the dry season; 2) water, located on the line defined for the regional isotopic gradient, recharged during the rainy season; and 3) water recharged at levels slightly higher than its theoretical value of recharge, showing a component of deep flow and recharge from river water in the coastal plain.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/467/428
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Diet and habitat of unique individuals of Dinohippus mexicanus and Neohipparion eurystyle (Equidae) from the late Hemphillian (Hh3) of Guanajuato and Jalisco, central Mexico: stable isotope studies","Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes were determined in molar enamel from fossil Pliocene equids from Rancho El Ocote in the San Miguel Allende basin, Guanajuato, and from Santa María, Tecolotlán basin, Jalisco. At each locality, the source was one molar from an individualDinohippus mexicanusand one molar from an individualNeohipparion eurystyle.Results indicated that theN.eurystyleindividuals from both localities had been C3/C4mixed feeders, and had lived in open-zone vegetation (δ13C: -3.1‰ to -1.3‰; δ18O: -4.9‰ to -6.4‰). On the other hand, theD.mexicanusfrom Rancho El Ocote had fed upon C4plants and lived in open zones (δ13C: -1.3‰; δ18O: -4.9‰), whereas theD.mexicanusfrom Santa María was a C3/C4mixed feeder with considerable consumption of C3plants (δ13C: -7.7‰; δ18O: -6.4‰). These results could be contrast to suggestions from previous isotopic work thatD.mexicanusin Mexico predominantly fed on C4plants and further samples analyses are warranted. This study contributes to the understanding of the Pliocene equid taxa from central Mexico and emphasizes the presence of different diets, ranging from exclusive C4to mixed C3/C4plants.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/470/429
