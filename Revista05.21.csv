The presence and activity of a variety of bacterial and archaeal microorganisms play a vital role in this process. An understanding of the microbial groups present in the anaerobic digester is important for augmenting the recovery of carbon and also will help in solving the digester related problems as the functioning of the digester depends on the microbial activity. Molecular characterization of the anaerobic bacteria present in a thermophilic (55ºC) anaerobic digester fed with poultry waste was analyzed by DNA extraction followed by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the obtained clones. Results showed that more than 75 per cent of the clones represented uncultured bacteria and among the different genera recorded, Clostridium sp. was dominant. Results demonstrated the need for obtaining more number of clones and a combination of different methods for reliable molecular characterization of an anaerobic digester.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1943/1008

In this work, a mammalian cell culture medium was formulated based on peptone and yeast extract with an industrial reagent level. Three different mammalian cell lines, OK, CHANG y LLCPK-1 were successfully grown in a 25:75 mix of MEM:MD (MEM = control medium; MD = house medium) as determined by comparing cell growth parameters, cellular morphology and susceptibility to HgCl2 with those obtained from cells grown in MEM medium. A greater amount of MD in the mix 5:95 produced nuclear morphological changes, altered nucleus-cytoplasm relationship and did not support cell growth, which was possibly due to a toxic concentration of metals in the peptone and yeast extract and also to the low concentration of zinc in the yeast extract.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1952/1010

However, agricultural and climate adversity limit the seed production, thereby plant cell culture in vitro is an alternative technology for Aza production. In this work, the state of the knowledge of A. indica cell culture is presented and the strategies for improving growth and production of Aza are analyzed. The use of cell membrane permeabilizing agents to liberate intracellular Aza, of biosynthetic precursors, light, temperature, and the effect of media culture are revised. The stirred tank bioreactor has been the most used for cell culture and the studies have been centered on impellers evaluation and the possibility of using the fed-batch regime. Calculated productivities show that the bioreactor is technologically appropriated for cultivation of A. indica cell cultures and bioinsecticide production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1953/1011

The strain was able to growth and produce pigments in these media. Nine culture media reported for pigment production were evaluated in solid state fermentation. Microorganism was able to of growth in all media tested, obtaining different specific growth rates, the highest specific growth rate was reported in the 1, 3 and 9 media (0.0903, 0.0874, y 0.0837 cm. h-1, respectively).

It was shown that ABTS +, by itself, oxidized, indigo blue, tannic and galic acids, brilliant blue G, Coomassie blue,orange 7 and p-cresol. Oxidation was assessed by important changes in their visible absorption spectra. It was also shown that oxidation of these compounds by a mixture of ABTS and laccase can be done in a cyclic manner, such a way the oxidation rate was 94 times higher for indigo, 17 times for brilliant blue G, 34 times for orange 7 and 5 times higher for p-cresol compared with using the mediator or the laccase alone. Those results show the feasibility of a recycling scheme for the final oxidation of a wide variety of aromatic compounds in which the enzyme is not directly in contact with the compound but through the intermediate ABTS +.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1957/1014

However, the seeds are obtained as by-product and have a considerable economic potential owing their nutritive value and yield. The aim of this work was to describe the imbibition kinetics and moisture sorption isotherms at 25, 35 and 45ºC, of three Roselle seed cultivars produced in Mexico (“Criollo”, “China” and “Sudan”). Results indicated that the imbibition process describes a curve that follows the Weibull distribution with a α coefficient of 12.99, 8.81 and 2.21 hours and a β coefficient of 0.83, 1.70 and 0.72 for the Criollo, China, and Sudan cultivars, respectively. The GAB and the Chung-Pfost models describe appropriately the moisture sorption isotherms. Monolayer moisture content (a coefficient of GAB model) was 3.97 to 5.71 d.b. which represents a water activity value ranging from 0.1 to 0.30. Total isosteric heats of sorption, in the equilibrium moisture content region of 6 to 22% d.b., ranging from 52.85 to 42.90 kJּmol-1, for the Criollo cultivar, 60.99 to 43.41 kJּmol-1, for the China cultivar and 51.23 to 43.20 kJּmol-1, for the Sudan cultivar. At equilibrium moisture content up to 12% d.b., total isosteric heat of sorption was similar to the vaporization enthalpy of water, but at a moisture content lower to 6% d.b. this variable reached the highest values.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1963/1020

EFFECT ON THE TEXTURAL PROPERTIES OF MASA AND TORTILLA,"The effect of addition of nixtamalized corn flour (HMN) to fresh nixtamalized corn masa (MFMN) over the textural properties of masa and tortilla was studied. The HMN levels were 10, 30 and 50%. The tests conducted were: texture profile at different levels of apparent relative strain (2, 10, 25 and 40%), hardness by penetration and adhesiveness in masa; rollability and extensibility in tortilla. All tests were conducted using a Texture Analyser TAX T2 texturometer. The apparent relative deformation (DRA) level influenced the manifestation of textural properties of masa and the pattern of change of these by effect of the added concentration of HMN. The MHMN was harder and resilient and displayed grater instantaneous elastic recovery, compared with the MFMN. With 25 and 50% of DRA, all masas were less elastic, resilient and cohesive and harder. When masa was evaluated at the lowest level of DRA, the addition of 30% of HMN to MFMN increased hardness, resilience and elasticity (instantaneous and total). With the highest level of DRA this mixture exhibited less cohesiveness, resilience and total elasticity. The incorporation of 30% of HMN to MFMN decreased adhesive properties. The changes in the textural properties of MHMN due to incorporation of HMN did not show significant differences in extensibility and rollability after 24 h of resting. We proposed to carry out tests in tortilla with greater times of storage and perform other tests like bending and one dimension extensibility in order to explore if they are more sensible to detect changes in tortilla texture caused by addition of HMN",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1964/1021

The fundamental idea consists on analytically inverting a differential operator by means of the solution of a boundary value problem associated to the original transport and reaction problem. The dependent variable is expressed then as function of the solution of such associated problem, which is the Green’s function. Among the advantages that this methodology presents are the smoothing of round-off errors as well as the exact incorporation of boundary conditions. A mandatory requirement for the application of this methodology is that the differential operator must me self-adjoint. To illustrate the potential of the method, diffusion and reaction problems are studied in a catalytic particle involving both linear and non-linear reaction kinetics; in addition, the effect of the external mass transfer resistances is analyzed and the application to non-isothermal, convective, transient and multicomponent problems is discussed. The predictions are compared with those resulting from the numeric solution using finite differences. The analysis is carried out in terms of both numeric (computer time, mesh size) and transport (Thiele modulus, Biot number) parameters.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1959/1016

The biosorption capacity of Agave azul leaves biomass was evaluated in batch experiments. These experiments included pH profile, time dependence, and the determination of adsorption capacity. Time profile experiments indicated that the adsorption of Pb ions by Agave azul biomass was time-dependent. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were used to describe the biosorption of Pb (II) onto the Agave azul leaves biomass at 298 K and pH 5.0. The correlation coefficient for the Freundlich isotherm was much higher than the coefficient for the Langmuir isotherm, indicating that only the Freundlich models fits the data. The maximum capacity (KF) was 105.52 10-2 mole/g for Pb (II). The adsorption capacity showed by Agave azul biomass was higher than the average values reported in the literature.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1958/1015

Six self-cleaning water circular fish tanks with a volume of 4.3 m3 were used, maintaining a 3.94 m3/day of average flow rate and constant aeration. A total of 371 rainbow trout, 524 ± 8 g initial wet weight were introduced in the system and fed with a commercial feed that contained 38% of protein. A total study time of 44 days was divided into three phases of 14, 17 and 13 days according to the load fish rate. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), un-ionized ammonia, nitrite and nitrate were daily evaluated at four monitoring sites: fish tank (FT), settling tank (ST), biofilter (B) and reconditioning tank (RT). Water physicochemical characteristics and their fluctuations played an important role in treatment efficiency. Water temperature varied between 18 °C and 20.5 °C and dissolved oxygen from 4.6 to 7.7 mg/l. The lowest values of these two variables were registered in the ST where all wastes accumulate. No significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed in pH values (8.3-8.6). These conditions allowed good nitrification and denitrification rates. TAN varied from 0.2 to 1.96 mg/l; however, this value was 80% lower in the outlet (RT) as compared to the inlet (ST). The load fish rate caused a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) in TAN and non-ionized ammonia in the FT with the lowest value for 89 kg load density as compared to 156 and 194 kg respectively. Conversely, nitrite concentration did not show a significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) among load fish rate. Nitrate concentration had an accumulative tendency at 156 kg load rate batch up to 30 days with a further decrease. The results showed that a reduction of load rate did not change apparently the equilibrium of bacteria population. Therefore, it is possible to control variables such as TAN, non-ionized ammonia and nitrite concentration, hence maintaining an adequate water quality for rainbow trout.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1962/1019

These portable microsystems would be able to accomplish the same tasks as conventional laboratory equipment, with the advantage of being faster and requiring a smaller sample volume. Thus, separation techniques on a microscale are acquiring a greater importance. Among these techniques, we can find the separation of particles by a dielectrophoretic force. Dielectrophoresis is an electrokinetic transport mechanism that occurs in the presence of a non-homogeneous electric field. Dielectrophoresis is a non-destructive technique with great potential for the separation and concentration of bioparticles. Insulator-based dielectrophoresis makes it possible to trap and concentrate particles inside a microchannel by applying an electric field. The magnitude of the dielectrophoretic force depends on the operating conditions: insulating structures geometry, electric field intensity, particle concentration, conductivity and pH of the suspending buffer. This work presents a parametric study on insulator-based dielectrophoresis with the objected of characterizing the performance of a dielectrophoretic microdevice, and obtaining the optimal conditions for the concentration and separation of a mixture of particles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1965/1022

In order to do this, it was necessary to modify the percentages of catalyst (potassium persulfate, KPS) and crosslinker (NNMBA) for poly (acrylamide). To evaluate their maximum degree of swelling and to determine the swelling kinetics, the quantity of fluids absorbed by films was measured at different temperatures (20, 30, and 40°C) and pH’s (acidic, basic, and neutral). According to the results obtained from the experiment, the most suitable temperature and pH were 30°C and neutral, conditions under which the highest swelling values were obtained. In the kinetic study, during the first hours, a first order kinetic (Fick Model) was observed. The results were non–Fickian, revealing that the chain’s diffusion and relaxation processes occur at the same time during the absorption of the solution. For longer periods of time, with the exception of a 40 °C temperature (where the first order kinetic was identified), a second order kinetic was observed (Schott Model), indicating that there is no polymeric chain relaxation, but rather, contraction and collapse of the material. The relaxations of the polymer chain were observed after swelling via SEM pictures.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1966/1023

In this work, it was determined by turbidimetry, the phase transition and stability by cloud point measurements. Particle size was monitored during the pressure induced phase separation from a homogeneous solution in cases where the CO2 is solvent (binary system) or antisolvent (ternary system). The studied systems were poly(fluorooctyl methyacrylate) (PFOMA)-CO2 and polystyrene (PS)-tetrahydrofuran (THF)-CO2, for different polymer concentrations, temperatures and pressures in the supercritical region of CO2. The results indicate that the system PFOMA-CO2 exhibits an LCST and for PS-THF-CO2 a combination of UCST-LCST phase behaviours are observed that is highly dependent on the THF-to-CO2 concentration ratio. By monitoring particle size in solution the transition stages and phase stability of stable-metastable-unstable states, which are associated with the spinodal region, are determined. The nucleation phenomenon appears once the solution crosses the spinodal curve toward the unstable area. In this region, the growth of the particles is exponential favouring coagulation that ultimately induces supersaturation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1967/1024

La ecuación de D’Arcy-Watt modeló correctamente los datos experimentales de adsorción de agua sobre PSL. El módulo de desviación relativa (P) fue 3.3, 1.3 y 3.7 % para 15, 30 y 45 °C respectivamente. La compensación entalpía-entropía (criterio termodinámico) mostró dos zonas: la primera fue controlada por la entropía (Temperatura isocinética (TB) = 56.2 ± 1.4 K) y se apreció desde humedad cero hasta la humedad correspondiente a la mínima entropía integral (MEI), mientras la segunda fue controlada por la entalpía (TB = 407.1 ± 6.8 K) y se observó desde la MEI hasta actividades de agua cercanas a 1.0. La teoría del bloqueo de poro (criterio cinético) sugirió que inmediatamente después de alcanzar la MEI, las moléculas de agua bloquearon la boca de los microporos formando una resistencia que disminuyó la velocidad de adsorción de agua.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1968/1025
