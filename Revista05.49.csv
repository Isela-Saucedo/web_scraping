The aerobic pretreatment was carried out under three incubation conditions: the first condition was at 30°C for 24 hours (isothermal), the second condition was at 30°C for 12 hours followed by 12 hours at 35°C, and the third condition was at 35°C for 12 hours followed by 12 hours at 40°C. During the aerobic pretreatment, the enzymatic activity was analyzed and the product obtained from the pretreatment was subsequently fermented in anaerobic hydrolytic leach bed (AHLB) reactors to obtain volatile fatty acids (VFA). The best hydrolysis results were achieved with the aerobic pretreatment at 30°C for 24 hours, obtaining activities of xylanases and pectinases of 115 and 73 U g-1dry matter (DM) respectively after 18 hours and 100 U g-1DM of proteases at the beginning of the process; values that are 2.7, 2 and 4 times higher than previously report. Also, a hydrolysis constant (k) of 0.081 d-1was obtained, with the productivity of VFA of 0.82gLr-1d-1, with predominance in acetate, the main precursor of methanogenesis in the final stage of anaerobic digestion.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/849/418

However, both long and short-range pollutants are now known to be present in the Antarctic environment. Canola oil is an example of a polluting hydrocarbon that can be accidentally released into the Antarctic environment in oil wastewater treatment plants. The Antarctic soil bacterial strainRhodococcussp. AQ5-07, known to be capable of using waste canola oil (WCO) as its sole source of carbon, was tested for its ability to degrade canola oil in the presence of different heavy metals and xenobiotics.Rhodococcussp. AQ5-07 was grown on minimum salt media containing different heavy metals (Zn, Co, Ni, Ag, Pb, Cu, Cr, Hg, Cd and As), xenobiotics (acrylamide and phenol) supplemented with 3% WCO. Three out of the 10 heavy metals tested (Hg, Cd and Ag) led a significant reduction in canola oil degradation at a concentration of 1 ppm. The IC50 values of Hg, Cd and Ag were 0.38, 0.45 and 0.32 ppm, respectively. The strain could also withstand 10 mg/L acrylamide, 50 mg/L phenol and 0.5% (v/v) diesel. This study confirmed the ability ofRhodococcussp. AQ5-07 to degrade canola oil in the presence of various heavy metals and other xenobiotics, supporting its potential use in bioremediation of vegetable oil and wastewater treatments in low temperature environments.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/917/422

The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth-promoting effect of a micropropagation system in a Temporary Immersion Bioreactor (TIB) and the inoculation withTrichoderma asperellumon theS. rebaudianaplants, and to determine their effect on the production of steviol glycosides and phenolic compounds.S. rebaudianaplants with intact roots were obtained using a TIB with Murashigue and Skoog medium and 0.37 mg L-1indole butyric acid, and subsequent the plants were inoculated with spores ofT. asperellum(4 x 104spores mL-1). The growth of plants inoculated with the fungus was significantly larger than the plants uninoculated (control). The plants inoculated produced 3 times more steviol glycosides than the plants uninoculated (control); while, the content of phenolic compounds was similar.

In this work, three substrates (crystalline and amorphous silicon, hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide) were biofunctionalized applying self-assembled monolayers technique, presence of characteristic functional groups of the assembly was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Anti-SalmonellaIgG antibodies against whole bacteria were generated. Second derivative of each FTIR detection spectrum was obtained, having modifications in the zone between 1600-1700 cm-1given by the secondary structure of proteins, being crystalline silicon and hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide platforms, which presented the most notorious bands. Detection was performed on flat substrates with a specific area (25 mm2), a detection time of 60 min was stablished and a concentration of 500 CFU/mL was detected.

Spherical agglomeration technique (SAT) was used to remove metals (Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cd). Two precipitating agents were tested: NaOH and Ca(OH)2. Also,Agave tequilanaWeber extract as hydrophobicizing agent was employed to avoid metal redisolution. High metal removal proved the effectiveness on SAT application under a pH ranging between 9 and 11 and extract doses from 0.3 g extract/g pollutant. Better removal percentages were reached when using Ca(OH)2as precipitating. Reported removal efficiency in that case yielded removal percentages as high as 99% removal for Pb under the three pH tested. The heavy metal evaluation index before treatment was 2354.91, but decreased to levels as low as 4.7 after SAT application.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1047/457

Though insecticides are used to control termites but it is not an ecofriendly approach. In the current study silver nano particles were produced fromAspergillus fumigatusBTCB10 and its effect was observed in controlling termites. Feeder blocks were treated with different concentrations (0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 15ppm) of nanoparticles and fed to the subterranean termites ofCoptotermes sp.for two weeks. Among all the concentrations used 15ppm was the most effective in which 100 % mortality was achieved on the 9thday and the mean weight loss of block was 3.3% as compared to control in which it was 32.2%. Among all the concentrations used 0.1 ppm treated blocks were also affected by fungus which showed that higher concentrations were also effective in inhibiting fungal growth. Conclusively, this study showed that mycosynthesized silver nanoparticles are very effective protecting the wood from damaging not only from termite but also from wood deteriorating fungus. Further study should be undertaken to bring this approach at commercial scale.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1022/462

In this study, we determined the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities of the aerial part ofA. austrokoreenseto assess its potential benefit to human health. The antioxidant activity was analyzed using two different methods, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power assays and suggested that the crude methanol extract and butanol fraction possessed strong antioxidant activity. Additionally, the aqueous fraction exhibited not only remarkable antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria but also significant inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells and cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, correlation analysis between the polyphenolic content and biological activities of the aerial part ofA. austrokoreensesuggests that phenolic compounds might be major contributors to the DPPH free radical scavenging and anti-cancer activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that the nonmedicinal parts ofA. austrokoreensecan also be used as a potential natural resource to develop effective dietary health supplements.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1067/556

With the side effects of the use of chemical and physical synthesis methods yielding toxic and unstable, researches have turned to green synthesis to produce nanoparticles using the mechanism of the bacteria specifically the nitrate reductase enzyme present in most bacteria to break down silver nitrate to silver nanoparticles which are stable and reduces the cost of production. Marine bacteria plays it role by being a reservoir that can intake heavy metals and breaking down with no difficulty as a result of their harsh habitat which is rich in heavy metals. This study was done to prove that marine bacteria can synthesize silver nanoparticles and the nanoparticles are stable and has a range of size and shape through preliminary studies. Marine bacteria were isolated from marine soil samples and later identified to belong to the genusSerratia. Synthesis of the nanoparticles were done using extracellular synthesis where equal amounts of bacterial supernatant and 0.5 M silver nitrate was added and incubated under dark condition for 72 hours. 20 isolates showed positive results for synthesis which were further examined using UV-Visible Spectra analysis showing all 20 samples having a range of size and shape of nanoparticles with peaks observed between the ranges of 340 nm to 440 nm, with the sample strain AQ5-NT6 being the most potent.

The study of pollution in Antarctica can help people to understand the real influence of human activities on the environmental pollution from polar regions. Bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the polar environment where toxic metals co-existed involves selecting strictly autochthonous Antarctic strains with dual catabolic competence and tolerance to toxic metals. In this study, diesel degradation was observed in the presence of 1 ppm of eight selected heavy metals; Ag, Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn. Bacterial growth was inhibited in increasing order of Zn> Cr> Cd> Al> Ni> Hg> Co> Ag. Bacterial growth was the highest in Zn at OD6000.556 (P>0.05) and lowest in Ag at OD6000.151 (P<0.05). Diesel degradation was inhibited in the order of Hg> Cr> Al> Zn> Ag> Cd> Ni> Co, which was analysed using gravimetry analysis. Degradation was the highest in Hg at 52.23% (P>0.05) and lowest in Co at 22.76% (P<0.05).

The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of extraction methods including microwave-assisted extraction, autoclave-assisted extraction, and hot water extraction on the polyphenolic composition, antioxidant activity, and anti-melanogenic activity ofP. japonicusleaves, stems, and roots. In comparison with other samples, leaf extracts exhibited strong DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power activity, and hydrophilic oxygen radical scavenging activity. In addition, the leaf extracts significantly suppressed α-MSH-induced melanin synthesis in B16F10 cells. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) analyses indicated that the anti-melanogenic effect of leaf extracts obtained by hot water extraction may result from the inhibition of ROS generation and the downregulation of tyrosinase expression in B16F10 cells. Furthermore, the extraction methods differentially affected the content of polyphenolic compounds and bioavailability ofP. japonicusextracts. Taken together, the antioxidant activity and anti-melanogenic effect of leaf hot water extracts suggest that the leaves ofP. japonicuscould be a beneficial source of natural antioxidants for skincare products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1186/640

Bioethanol can be obtained from wheat straw and can be readily available as clean fuel for combustion engines. Therefore,Wickerhamomyces anomalusyeast strain IHZ-26 was used to produce bioethanol from sugar solution obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of  wheat straw. Nineteen different fermentation media were used for this purpose in which carbon source employed was sugar solution obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of  wheat straw. Out of which, maximum bioethanol yield (1.09 g/L; p <0.05) was observed in ‘C1 Yeast extract, peptone, glucose’ medium.  After optimization of different cultural parameters, surface culture fermentation for 5 days at 25℃ gave maximum results using 2, 1.5 and 2 g of glucose, xylose and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, respectively. Four hours old inoculum of yeast in a concentration of 3.5% was optimized for maximum bioethanol yield. These optimized parameters resulted in augmented bioethanol production (5.0g/L) by 5.02 folds.

Five monokaryons were recovered employing homogenization time periods between 60 to 90 s, and incubation at 28oC in a peptone-glucose solution (PGS) forPleurotusspp. Mycelial kinetics on MEA and wheat grain were determined using 4 math models, the parental strains on MEA showed μmaxvalues between 8.11 and 10.73 mm day-1and on wheat grain presented μmaxvalues since 0.23 to 9.18 cm3day-1, while the reconstituted strains on MEA exhibited μmaxvalues ranged from 8.68 and 12.93 mm day-1and on wheat grain showed μmaxvalues between 0.25 and 9.30 cm3day-1. The parental and reconstituted strains were cultivated using two agricultural wastes such as wheat straw (WS) and a mixture of oak sawdust, wheat straw, millet seed, cotton seed hull and CaCO3(AP). The productivity and chemical composition of the mushrooms, and also the chemical composition of the substrates before and after harvest were determined. Reconstituted strainPleurotus djamor(DS2xDS4) cultivated on WS showed the highest biological efficiency (125.84 %) and production rate (2.79 %), and also this strain produced on AP presented the highest productivity parameters: biological efficiency (98.43 %) and productivity rate (2.27 %).

The purpose of this work was to develop a dehydrated mixture using pumpkin flour and modified yam starch. The study included the formulation of dehydrated mixture based on the starch/flour ratio and the type of starch modification. With analysis by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) peaks were identified in 1366 – 1367 cm-1corresponding to beta-carotene in the flour. With starch modifications gelatinization temperature increased reaching values of 83.6 and 86.3°C. All the rehydrated formulations showed pseudoplastic rheological behavior where the viscosity decreased with the shear rate. The mixture most preferred by consumers and that showed the highest overall desirability (0.47) was the formulation with 60% flour and 10% enzymatically modified starch.

Due to this, the study of methods and conditions that allow to improve  traditional processes for their extraction from achiote seeds is of particular interest. In some cases, the functional activity of the obtained extracts is also evaluated. In this work we study the effect of a sonication treatment on the extraction of functional compounds of achiote seeds, as well as the antioxidant activity of such extracts, in comparison to a traditional maceration extraction. Sonication has shown some advantages such as being simple to apply, reducing extraction times and increasing extraction yields. The comparisons are made in hydrophilic and hydrophobic extracts obtained from 5 accessions of achiote from Yucatan, Mexico. When applying sonication, the content of polyphenols (18-25%) and norbixin (25-55%) in the extracts was increased, as well as the antioxidant activity of the hydrophilic (18-22%) and hydrophobic (10-20%) phases; however, the sonication had no effect on the content of bixin, the latter being the main product of commercial interest. These results suggest that sonication extraction can be a valuable alternative for obtaining extracts with higher contents of functional compounds or enhanced norbixin contents from achiote seeds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/916/426

Here, nanoemulsions were prepared via an ultrasound emulsification method. We evaluated the effect of lipid concentration (4-7 %), surfactant concentration (0.1-2.0 %), and sonication time (15-30 min) on the particle size while holding astaxanthin content (0.2%) constant. The particle sizing used transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and dynamic light scattering including ζ-potential. The antioxidant activity was studied as a function of ABTS+radical concentration, and a spectrophotometric method was used to study the stability of the nanoemulsions over time. The increase of the sonication time and the amount of emulsifier reduce the particle size. The best conditions to prepare stearic acid and astaxanthin nanoemulsions were: 4.0% of lipid concentration and 2.0% for surfactant content employing a sonication time of 15.0 min.

Mechanical properties (tensile strength, percentage of elongation and Young's modulus), water vapor permeability and film adsorption isotherms were evaluated. In the formulations containing the intermediate concentrations of the components, a homogeneous surface, an improvement in fracture stress and a decrease in water vapor permeability were observed. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the mechanical properties of the composite films (p < 0.05). The GAB model was used to adjust the experimental data of the adsorption isotherms and a higher moisture content of the films containing the highest concentration of starch and essential oil was observed. The F6 (starch 3.5%, clove essential oil 60 mg/L) formulation showed the lowest water vapor permeability values (1x10-8g/ m s Pa) and the lowest moisture content in the monolayer, which is considered to be the material with the best characteristics for its possible application, avoiding the excessive use of raw material during its preparation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/965/555

K. Koch)] during storage,"Pecan nut kernels are rich in health-promoting substances such as unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols, and phenolic compounds. Due to their importance in the human diet, it is essential to evaluate the effects of drying, and storage temperature and time, on these phytochemicals. Moisture, water activity, lipid content, bioactive compounds concentration, and antioxidant capacity of wet and dry pecan nuts (Western variety) were determined. Then kernels and in-shell nuts were stored (240 days) at 4°C and 25°C, monitoring the changes in tocopherols concentration, phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity. Wet and dry kernels exhibited similar fatty acids profile and γ-tocopherol concentration (20.37±0.73 and 19.27±1.62 mg·100 g-1kernels in dry basis), whereas phenolic content and antioxidant capacity decreased due to the drying process (33.2 and 22.3%, respectively). Throughout storage, condensed tannins concentration of kernels and in-shell nuts reduced by 31.5 and 41.8%, while DPPH antioxidant capacity improved 216.4 and 188.4%, respectively. These results evidenced that drying and storage time are the most significant variables regarding pecan nuts postharvest processing; nonetheless, further research related to the relationship between condensed tannins degradation and the increments in DPPH antioxidant capacity is needed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1149/646

However, an alternative option allows the use of a donor that generates hydrogen in situ (either by transfer and / or catalytic reforming), instead of using molecular hydrogen. Ethanol and formic acid, which are biorefinery streams, were used as donors. The effect of metallic catalysts of Pd and Pt, supported on C, g-Al2O3and zeolite USY, on the generation of hydrogen was evaluated using different ratios between the active phase and the donor, and different times and temperatures of reaction in a high pressure reactor (up to 1000 psi). The catalysts were characterized by DRX, SEM, FTIR and FRX. At the same time, High-Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (HP DSC) was performed for the most promising systems with a ramp of 10 °C/min. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the production of hydrogen. Findings show that the system that generates more hydrogen, with 88%, is 5% Pd/C over 30% formic acid at 300 °C, 500 rpm and a ratio catalyst mass to donor from 1 to 10 (0.028 m).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/652/428

The treatment of the films with plasma was accomplished supplying 1.57 kV voltage with a current of 0.74 A, while the working frequency was 5.54 kHz. The exposure times of the films to the plasma were 20, 40, and 60 min. Results showed that the stress-strain mechanical properties for an untreated film was 2.6 N with an elongation of 17 mm, while for the treated film was 66 N with an elongation of 6 mm; thus, improving its mechanical properties. The adsorption capacity of films, treated during 40 min at pH close to neutral using a mass of 15 mg, was qe = 757 mg/g. The morphology of the film before its treatment showed a smooth surface; while after treatment, some pores were observed, probably produced by the impact of pyrrole ions onto the surface of the film. The FTIR analysis allowed to identify the functional groups before and after films treatment; it showed a reduction of -OH groups that belongs to chitosan, and the presence of N-H, C-N, and C=C groups, which corresponds to the aromatic ring of the polypyrrole molecule.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/893/503

The biomaterial was characterized before and after removal by FTIR analysis which reported the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups; and SEM analysis showing a porous surface in the form of fibrous cylinders typical of lignocellulosic materials, evidencing that Pb (II) ions are captured on the surface of the adsorbent.

The adsorption was carried out making use of fixed-bed columns packed with beads of Alginate-Chitosan Sulfate (Alg-ChS) hydrogels. Two columns with heights of 13 and 33 cm, and two feed rates (20 and 40 mL/h) were used. The pH of the dye solutions at the exit of the columns was much higher than that at the entrance which can be explained by protons transfer from the aqueous solution to the amino and hydroxyl groups of the Alg-ChS and to the carboxilate groups of the alginate. The increase in pH was favorable for the removal of the dye. The breakthrough time and the amount of dye removed decreased when the flow rate was increased. A greater dye removal was achieved when the higher column was used. After the breakthrough time, the columns continued to remove appreciable amounts of dye and even after 50 hours of operation, column saturation was not obtained.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1123/639

Kinetic, thermodynamics and characterization","Dilute acid hydrolysis at high temperature is one technique to pretreat and produce monomeric sugars from lignocelluloses; however, its main disadvantage is the production of inhibitory aldehydes. In this paper, sugar production was realized by acid hydrolysis of corn stover employing 2.2 M hydrochloric acid solution and low temperature range (60 – 80 ºC). Experimental data were great fitted to different kinetic models, thermodynamic parameters were calculated from first order, Saeman and Saeman biphasic kinetic model, rate constants showed similar values between each other demonstrating that corn stover hydrolysis is an endothermic and non-spontaneous process capable to generate thermodynamically stable products.

This work evaluated the anaerobic co-digestion of VW with cow manure (CM) as a strategy to improve the process stability. As a reaction system, a 4 L semi-continuous stirred tank reactor with an HRT of 20 days and fed with a substrate formulation of 40 g of VS was used in two periods: 34 days of VW mono-digestion and 26 days of VW:CM co-digestion. The mono and co-digestion processes were numerically evaluated through three analysis tools: a proposed co-digestion model embedded in the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 structure, statistical process control theory, and modeling the pH dynamics as the response of a first-order linear system to an impulse manipulation. The mono-digestion process showed productivity of 0.381 L CH4L digester-1d-1, which increased by 14 % during co-digestion. The results also indicated that in VW:CM co-digestion, the pH dynamics presents a slower response to the daily feed induced by pulses, keeping the values of this parameter within the statistical stability range; as well as the early warning indicator IA/BA (ratio between intermediate and bicarbonate alkalinity) outside the failure thresholds. It was shown that the addition of CM to a mono-digestion of VW increases the buffer capacity of the system and the production of CH4, promoting a stable and efficient process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/920/424

Linear and natural cooling profiles were induced with stirring speeds of 90 and 180 rpm in batchs of 240 and 300 minutes. Changes in sugar solubility in water, due to RP, were analyzed. At the end of each experiment, the crystals were filtered and dried; the RP concentration, adhered to their faces and encapsulated, was measured and the percentage of degradation was determined. These measurements were repeated during 60 days with the fortified crystals, stored at ambient conditions in paper bags. In addition, organoleptic tests were performed to determine differences in taste against commercial sugar. The results showed that: it was possible to encapsulate the RP seeds to fortify the sugar, the degradation of the RP in the process was less than 32%, there were no significant changes in either solubility or taste and the proposed process increased the shelf life of fortified sugar.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/841/427

After every removal process, ACFF was thermally treated (calcinated) for reuse. The surface morphology was characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis helped to identify functional groups that allowed adsorption process. Batch experiments were carried out at 27 °C with a pH of 10. Results revealed that after calcination, the MB adsorbed turned to carbon deposits, which desorbed during others removal processes, this allowed reusing of ACFF for several adsorption cycles with no significant change in adsorption capacity. The adsorption data followed Langmuir isotherm with the kinetics of pseudo-first-order, which suggests that chemisorption was carried on for removal of MB. The novelty of this work focuses on reusing, through calcination of ACFF, which allows removal efficiency more than 99% up to ten cycles, whereby removal of methylene blue from wastewater by activated carbon fiber felt could be cheaper than other proposed methods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1184/698

The combined effects of MMT and CEO using M1 produced films with lower WVP and higher tensile strength compared with M2, probably because MMT in M1 had more time in contact with CH than in M2. Also, SEM display a more compact structure in films using M1 with CEO. X-ray diffraction show that films with M1 were exfoliated while with M2 had an intercalated structure.

In order to show the applicability and effectiveness of the development, the proposed controller is tested on a coupled-tank system and the results are compared with a centralized nonlinear model predictive controller.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/778/452

Simulation with ASPEN PLUS v7.2 was used as process analysis tool. A simulation model of the concentration process was obtained and models reported by the literature were used to simulate the incineration and generation of electricity. The model was validated with the real data of the process with a maximum validation error 5,5 % for the total condensates. The necessary conditions were determined to increase the final concentration of the vinasse up to 60 ºBrix. The flow of concentrated vinasse was reduced by 48%, the problem of production shutdowns due to the unavailability of stillage storage was solved and 87 kg/h of potassium rich ash and 632 kW of electric power were obtained. Likewise, an economic analysis was carried out that demonstrated the feasibility of applying the proposed technology.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/883/486
