SEED OIL OVER Ni-Mo CATALYST FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION,"The catalytic hydroconversion of vegetable oil (CHVO) process associate vegetable oil triglyceride transformation to linearchain alkanes, via hydrodeoxygenation reactions (HDO) to generate multiple hydrocarbon compounds similar to heavy vacuum oil. The CHVO process was applied toJatropha curcasseed oil, on commercial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) NiMo/Al₂O₃ catalyst under HDS operation conditions.Jatropha curcasseed oil triglycerides conversion were observe by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and validated by Gas Chromatography (CG/MSD). The process occurs through three reaction pathways including: decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation where the carboxylgroup is removed from the fatty acids to produce alkanes similar to fossil fuels. Infrared spectroscopy in CHVO process showed to be a useful method to evaluate the catalytic activity by monitoring specific frequencies intensities of C=O and C-O bonds in carboxylic group. The intensity reduction of these bonds to linear hydrocarbons it associated as a way to quantify for CHVO process",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/696/234

Often, these types of products are supplied in a granulated form to facilitate its dosage to ruminants as cows, sheep, among others. To produce granulated bioproducts based on microorganisms, it is required to select suitable drying conditions, protectants and the adequate drying operation, decisive factors to guarantee cell viability and stability during storage. Most granulated products are dried through fluidized bed drying process reducing investment and maintenance costs, and improving mass and heat transfer decreasing operation time and the risk of product overheating. Therefore, in this work a selection ofdrying protectants through decision matrix was conducted based on parameters as compatibility with Lv196 and cost of protectants. The best two drying protectants were used as functional coadjuvants in the formulation of two granulated prototypes. Drying temperature, chamber pressure and the two prototypes were evaluated in an experimental design to select adequate conditions for a fluidized bed drying process. Finally, the stability of two dried granulated prototypes using selected conditions was determined. Prototype PF2 dried at 45ºC and 0.5 bar during 30 min had a final moisture of 7.84 ± 0.01% and operation yield of 98.54 ± 0.11% guaranteeing a los of viability lower tan 2.09 ± 0.01% after 15 months of storage at room temperature.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/701/238

The effects of temperature and nitrogen limitation on the growth, proximate composition, and fatty acid profile of Nannochloropsis sp. were studied using solvent-oil extraction aided by ultrasonic process as a promoter of microalgae cell disruption. Experiments included a control algal culture grown in F medium (F) at 25°C and four cultures grown in F with half the original concentration of sodium nitrate (F/2) at 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, and 40°C. The results showed that temperature had significant effects on the cell density and growth rate of Nannochloropsis sp. The highest values were obtained when microalgae cultured in F at 25°C, whereas the lowest were obtained in F/2 at 35°C. The protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents were the highest in F at 25°C and had an increasing tendency in F/2 from 25°C to 30°C; however, the lowest values were obtained in F/2 at 35°C. Both the temperature and nitrogen limitation highly affected the fatty acid profile of Nannochloropsis sp. The proportion of polyunsaturated compounds decreased with increasing temperature from 25°C to 35°C, whereas it increased with nitrogen limitation. These results generate alternatives in Nannochloropsis sp culture conditions that allow have qualitatively best products in relation to their potential use in food and biofuels.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/708/239

This work investigated the differences in the production of those compounds among in vitro cultures (organs from plantlets and roots cultures) of T. parthenium. Results showed that the in vitro cultures produced PHEC and PTN, which depended on the type of culture and the incubation time. The content of secondary metabolites was higher in shoots of plantlets (S-ivPL), followed by root cultures (R-ivC) and roots of plantlets (R-ivPL). The PHEC and PTN production was enhanced in plantlets by applying a combination of plant growth regulators (PGRs: α-naphtalenacetic acid [NAA] at 0.27 µM with kinetin [KIN] at 2.32 µM). The highest content of secondary metabolites (62.54 mg gallic acid equivalents g−1 ; 4.261 and 4.973 mg chlorogenic acid g−1 ; 0.858 and 1.015 mg caffeic acid g−1 ; 1.931 mg salicylic acid g−1 ; 0.071 mg PTN g−1) was found in the PGRs-treated S-ivPL samples.

The open reading frame of the Nsi xyn11A gene was 945 base pairs long and encoded a polypeptide of 314 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 33.3 kDa. TheNsi xyn11Agene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme was characterized to evaluate its hydrolytic capacity on lignocellulosic biomass, showing preference onAgave tequilanabagasse. The enzyme Nsi Xyn11A showed an optimal activity at pH 5.5 and 55 °C. Nsi Xyn11A is thermostable as it showed half-lives of more than 2h at 70 and 80 °C and more than 4 h at 50 and 60 °C. This is the first report describing the cloning and expression of an endo-1,4-β-xylanase encoding gene fromN.sitophilaand the hydrolytic characterization of the new xylanase Nsi Xyn11A. Our study showed that the xylanase Nsi Xyn11A may be suitable for industrial applications in the food and feed industries, in the production of short chain xylooligosaccharides, or in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass required to improve the yields of fermentable sugars for bioethanol production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/710/241

The expression of the endopolygalacturonase gene (EPG) from this yeast was compared under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and was related to the enzyme activity. Specific enzyme production under anaerobic conditions (0.233 uPG mg−1) was five times higher than that obtained under aerobic conditions (0.048 uPG mg−1), demonstrating that anaerobic growth promotes the synthesis of endo-PG; relative quantification ofEPGgene expression was 21.19 times higher in anaerobic culture, suggesting that production of endo-PG under anaerobic culture conditions is a consequence of the regulation of theEPGgene by dissolved oxygen saturation in the growth medium. Results point out that the higher production of endo-PG under anaerobic culture conditions is a consequence of the regulation of EPG gene.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/711/242

In this work, the kinetics of the fermentation was studied and the biomass produced at 53 h of fermentation was 36.7g that correspond to a 74.6% of the initial value, with a pH of 4.67 ± 0.02. A reduction of 1.55 pH unit was achieved at the end of the fermentation, due to growth of tibicos and production of ethanol. During fermentation, lactic acid was produced reaching a value of 0.477g lactic acid/100mL and the kinetics was described with a first order model withR2= 0.989, k = 5.49 h−1 y t1/2 = 12.62 h. A linear relation between total rate of production of phenols and the rate of change of antioxidant activity was foundindicating that phenols mainly provide the antioxidant activity since during fermentation they are liberated and becoming available.

Milling is done with three different mills: balls (impact), rollers (shear and compression) and blades (shear), under different operating conditions. The analysis of the grinding operation is done using the ASTM sieve series Nº 5, 6, 10, 12, 25, 30 and pan. The obtained products are classified in fine, medium and large, thus analyzing the yields of each fraction in each mill. Being the interest’s fraction the corresponding to medium sized particles, it is concluded that the roller and blades mills are the most adequate once since yields greater than 55% are achieved when operated with a single pass. Also, the specific energies developed for the milling were calculated with the Bond’s Law for comparison purposes.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/722/246

In order to evaluate the samples in the 2D system, three secondary stationary phases were established: SBL-IL61, Supelcowax and HP-50. Results showed that only polar secondary coating, SBL-IL61, was able to perceive a crucial difference between the samples. The largest difference was observed in the identification of the highest concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) in aged soybean biodiesel, such as C20: 4n-6, C20: 5n-3, C20: 3 and C21: 5. These compounds are quite prone to oxidation, which would lead to devaluation of biodiesel as a final product, thus may be used as markers for biodiesel degradation. In consequence, ananalytical technique that provides increased detection of these biodiesel quality-dependent compounds is recommended.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/749/261

The existence of transgenic food in the market and the lack of information in food labeling indicating the product’s action, certification of origin, and the quality of foodstuff have required the development of powerful tools to detect the transgenic organisms in food. In this study the DNA’s integrity processed tomato food was evaluated. Preparation of tomato puree and ketchup were required to evaluate the influence of additives on the integrity, quality, and amplificability of genomic DNA of tomato to detect transgenic genes. Samples of fresh tomato were analyzed as positive control. The accD, LAT52, and PG amplicons indicated the presence of transgenic tomato fruits. The ingredients or acid additives and storage time were the most important factors that affected the detection of transgenes.

Color removal was monitored by spectrophotometry and mineralization was determined by TOC analysis. A two-first-order in-series reactions model was developed; it takes into consideration reaction times where the intermediates prevail. In this reaction scheme, the first reaction is the degradation of the coloured dye into coloured intermediates, and the second reaction is the conversion to colorless products. Good agreement was observed between experimental data and the developed kinetic model.

The nitrite consumption efficiencies for the concentrations evaluated from 15 to 50 mg/L of NO₂̅-N were above 95%, while the ammonium consumption efficiency increased from 14 to 48%. In experiments with 70 and 100 mg/L of NO₂̅-N, nitrite consumption efficiencies were 74 and 58% respectively. The higher nitrite concentrations tested inhibited the anammox process since the specific rates diminished at 0.51 and 0.44 mg NO₂̅-N/g VSS d respectively. This study provides new and useful information about the anammox activity in sludges coming from wetlands, and these can be used as potential inoculum to treat wastewaters into anammox reactors, or in constructed wetlands.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/836/292

As Functional Unit (FU) was used 1 ton of waste. Two scenarios were considered: MSWM with conventional landfill (A) and MSWM that use the landfill gas to generate electricity (EG). The hotspot of the A scenario was the landfill, the severest midpoint indicator was the climate change, quantified at 2914 kg of CO₂ eq/FU, which contributes significantly to the endpoint indicator damage to human health, evaluated at 90 Pt/FU in terms of single score. For the EG scenario the results showed that the environmental impact was reduced to 298 kg of CO₂ eq/FU and 5 Pt/FU for climate change and damage to human health, respectively. In the overall analysis, the environmental damage for A and EG scenarios was estimated at 90.5 and -20.8 Pt/FU, respectively. This work shows that the EG scenario represents an alternative potential for environmental improvement. However, due to the emissions from landfill will continue for 50 years, causing damage to human health and ecosystems is considered a persistent environmental passive.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/837/293

However, it has a very low affinity and it makes necessary to use large amounts of salt when RY84 is applied on cellulosic substrates. In this study, RY84 was treated by ozone in model solutions using a semi-batch bubbling reactor in order to recover water and salt for a further utilization in dyeing processes. Ozonation processes were carried out on solutions prepared at concentrations of dye as a typical dyehouse wastewater. In a first approach, it was analyzed the influence of initial dye concentration, initial temperature without further heating, and pH, on the ozonation. Additionally, with the scope to study the effect of chemical auxiliaries on ozonation process and on the result of reusing of treated water, model solutionssimulating real effluents were prepared and ozonated. It was demonstrated that reusing of ozonated water is feasible, despite of the presence of ozonation byproducts and its accumulation during successive reusing cycles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/838/294

As a result of laser treatment directed ceramic composite new type of ceramic material is formed. It consists of three layers with different thickness. The top layer is enriched with YAlO₃, the middle layer (real body of molten trace ceramic) YAG mainly contains texturing and third layer is where laser-beam does not penetrate the content of these phases depends on irradiation regime and phase chemical composition of the ceramics. Y₃Al₅O₁₂ crystallites in the second layer have textured. The crystallographic texturing (TC) depends on the irradiation regime and the phase relationship Y₃Al₅O₁₂/Al₂O₃.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1131/433

These iron oxides were collected from the main iron ore mines in operation in Mexico. Of the six materials evaluated,two effectively interacted with arsenic and fluoride. Adsorption isotherms of both anions adjusted to the Langmuir model, and adsorption kinetics for both anions were slow. The effect of the presence of arsenic in the fluoride adsorption capacity,and vice verse, was evaluated. Moreover, the effect of pH and the presence of coexisting anions in natural water were determined on the adsorption capacity of arsenic and fluoride on natural iron oxides.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1147/446

The UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy results verified that the nanoparticles(NPs) uniformly distributed in the base liquid. Thermal and optical properties of the prepared nanofluids were investigated using photoacoustic spectroscopy and minimum deviation methods. Ethylene glycol, ethanol, and distilled water were used as standard liquids to optimise the experimental setup. The effective thermal effusivity and the refractive index of chromium nanofluids, in ethylene glycol, were measured and the effects of mass fractions were clarified. The results showed that NPs significantly enhance the thermal and optical properties of the investigated nanofluids.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1207/484
