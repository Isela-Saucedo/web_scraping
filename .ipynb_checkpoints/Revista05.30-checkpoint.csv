The mycelial weight, protein production, and naringinase activity were quantified. The constants Vmax and Km were determined by Lineweaver-Burk. It was found that molasses compared with the other carbon sources and the addition of calcium carbonate favored the growth of the fungus but not the production of protein or the enzyme activity. Additionally, it was found that naringin promoted 8-fold more production of protein (5684 ± 784 µg·mL−1) than the other carbon sources studied if Ca2+and Mg2+were added. On the other hand, rhamnose with no added salts produced 2-fold more enzyme activity than other treatments (2290 ± 157 U·mg−1). Finally, it was found that its kinetic characteristics were Vmax=13.24 U·mg−1and Km=1.6 mM, compared with the activity of a commercial naringinase from P. decumbens (Vmax=3.96 U·mg−1and Km=2.5 mM).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1602/745

In this work, we show that this fungus produces also an extracellular protease. The extracellular protease was partially purified using two-step purification, by (NH4)2SO4fractionation and DEAE-sepharose anion exchange chromatography with 4.25-fold factor purification. The optimal pH for protease activity, using hemoglobin as substrate, was 3.5. Results from protein purification revealed that this protease is an aspartic protease. Protease activity was inhibited 73% by pepstatin A, a specific inhibitor of acid proteases. Results allow conclude that A. rouxii produce an extracellular aspartic protease that has similar characteristics to aspartic proteases produced by fungi as Mucor and Rhizopus.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1603/746

The mixture chemistry composition was determined and pretreated with NaOH at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0% for 30, 60 y 90 minutes. The pretreated straw bean was subject to enzymatic hydrolysis for 10 days at 45◦C and a pH of 4.5, using a cellulase enzymatic load of 25 UPF/g of cellulose, from a commercial enzymatic concentrate (Celluclast 1.5 L) provided by Novozyme. The produced sugars were determined using the Miller method, and the obtained values used to calculate the hydrolysis yield. The pretreatment and hydrolysis optimal conditions were calculated using the surface response method. The results shown that the straw bean mixture is composed by: 31% of cellulose, 23% of hemicelluloses and 90% of lignin. The pretreatment affects significantly the hydrolysis yield. The maximum saccharification (98.95 ± 8.38%) was obtained with a pretreatment with 0.5% NaOH for 90 minutes at 121◦C and hydrolysis for 240h at pH 4.5 and 45◦C, using a cellulose enzymatic charge of 25UPF/g of cellulose.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1604/747

The aim of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts. The ethanol extract presented a high anthocyanin (102±7.70 mg Cyd-3-glu/100 g extract) and polyphenol (1732±43.40 mg GAE /100 g extract) content and a high scavenging antioxidant activity (73.47±0.01%) in accordance with the reducing power (3.164±0.028), redox potential (395±2 mV) and optical density (0.921±0.08). It also presented antimicrobial activity against the majority of gram (−) bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomona aeruginosa, but only against one gram (+) bacterium: Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, said extract inhibited yeast activity, but had no effect on molds. Therefore, this ethanol extract could present potential as a food additive.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1621/755

The aim of the present work was to study the effect of glucose on PDO production using different initial concentrations (20-200 mM) under anaerobic conditions by L. reuteri ATCC 23272. Biomass was monitored by optical density at 600 nm and substrates and products profiles were analyzed by HPLC. The highest PDO concentration attained was 16.81 g/L in flasks (37◦C, 100 mM glucose/200 mM glycerol for 16 h at pH 5.5, under anaerobic conditions). At fermenter level, a production of 28.69 g/L was reached under the same conditions, except glucose (200 mM) and glycerol (400 M). Stoichiometric and kinetic parameters showed that the 0.5 glucose/glycerol ratio allowed the highest PDO production. The flux calculated for glucose (Fglu) and glycerol (Fgly) in the co-fermentations with the highest PDO productions, had almost a 0.5 ratio.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1624/758

IN MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE PACKAGING,"The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) at 4◦C on the storage life of ‘Milpa Alta’ cactus stems without spines was studied. Atmospheres containing air, 5 kPa O2+ 4 kPa CO2and Nitrogen were applied. Quality attributes and the production of fermentation metabolites were evaluated during the storage. Results indicated that ‘Milpa Alta’ cactus stems had a significant reduction in titratable acidity (TA), but not significant changes were found in firmness and color values in cactus stems during storage. The weight loss was higher in control (6-8 %) than in MAPs stored cactus stems (0.1 to 0.8 %). Control and treated cladodes showed browning symptoms on areas where spines were removed, but MAPs delay the time when they appeared and the damage intensity. Also, cactus stems kept in MAPs showed an increase in acetaldehyde and ethanol production. The MAP with nitrogen induced the lowest levels of fermentation metabolites and preserved the quality of Milpa Alta cactus stems up to 20 days in storage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1635/767

The morphometric parameters: area (A), perimeter (P), shape factor (SF) and compactness (C) of each tissue (epicarp, mesocarp and vascular bundle) were quantified by Digital Image Analysis (DIA). Results indicated that curing induces structural disruptions of the vanilla tissues which is more pronounced in the mesocarp. Shape factor and compactness showed highest values in pods subjected to 10 cycles of sunning-sweating (10 SS) in which the highest concentration of vanillin and the lowest water looses were detected. It is possible to recommend a reduction of curing time from 20-25 SS cycles to 10.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1636/769

A method based on aminopropyl solid-phase extraction (SPE), followed by GC-MS analysis was employed for the identification and quantification of COPs. Two kinetic runs were performed: 60 min and 48 h of treatment. In the short run (60 min), 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol were detected in similar amounts after 30 and 15 min, respectively. Oxysterols present in higher amounts in the long run (48 h) were 7β-hydroxycholesterol (12.6 mg/g) and 5,6α-epoxycholesterol (13.4 mg/g). However, compounds whose formation is related to enzymatic oxidation and/or irradiation were detected, as 6-ketocholestanol (3.38 mg/g) and 4βhydroxycholesterol (2.04 mg/g). 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.12 mg/g) was found after only 1 h, reaching 0.99 mg/g after 48 h of treatment. The results suggest that due to the physical state of cholesterol, the oxidative pattern was changed, favoring unusual routes, such as formation of 4β-OH and 6-keto from breakage of the epoxide ring. Regarding 25-hydroxycholesterol, it is assumed that the solid state favored exposure of the side chain, rendering it more susceptible to oxidation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1626/759

In our study, three phases were identified: one gaseous (air) and two liquids (oil and aqueous). Two Re of the liquid species, one for each phase, were defined: Reaqand Reoilcorresponding to the aqueous and oil phase, respectively. Since gas phase was considered by hold up (εg) in our work. In 10 L ALR, riser showed turbulent aqueous phase flow (4000 < Reaq< 9000) whereas downcomer exhibited non-turbulent flow (1250 < 4000). Reoil in riser (5000 < Reoil< 10000) was higher than Reaq; whereas in downcomer, Reoilwas lower than Reaq (200 < Reoil< 2200). The oil phase into the downcomer zone was demonstrated to be the most important hydrodynamic constraint and consequently limited mass transfer should be expected. The complexity of three-phase flow and the limited measurement technologies have generated few studies regarding the local hydrodynamics properties restricting three-phase reactors optimization and commercialization; our study is a contribution to identify such restrictions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1627/760

The methanogenic activity determination was made for the sludge and the characterization for influent and effluent was made through the organic matter and suspended solids content, pH, alkalinity and inorganic ions, and as well as the quantification of total and fecal coliform bacteria, protozoa and helminth eggs. The methane productivity for the residual wastewater was of 0.016 L CH4/LR·d and the removal efficiency of the total and soluble organic matter was of 25.4±7.2 and 30±8.2%, respectively. The mean total suspended solids content in the influent was of 60±8.6 mg/L with a removal efficiency of 24±9%. The pH level was around 7.5 and 8.6, with high levels of alkalinity (around 0.8). In the effluent a reduction in the sulfate content was found and an increase in ammonium and orthophosphates concentration. The total and fecal coliform bacteria diminished in a 90% and the helminth egg reduction was between 89.5 and 98%. Some protozoa were found and the genera Frontonia and Spirostomum predominated.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1632/765

For this purpose, parallel plate and continuous flow electrochemical reactors were constructed, both with perforated plate aluminum anodes and iron mesh cathodes, for the application of electro-coagulation. The process variables studied were the applied current and the concentration of supporting electrolyte, in the case of parallel plate reactor and also the volumetric flow rate, in the case of continuous flow reactor. According to the results, it is possible to eliminate the turbidity of the Tamazula river water with this process, achieving compliance with the official Mexican standards under the conditions studied. The general conclusion is that the electro-coagulation process has a great potential for application in turbidity removal for treatment of the three types of water sources used.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1633/766

This zeolite crystallized with different morphologies from gels prepared from the diatomites. The analyzed gels had the following chemical composition: Na2O= 0.87; Al2O3= 1.0; SiO2= 8.7; BCTA= 0.87; H2O= 217.5. The synthesis was carried out under hydrothermal conditions, at 110◦C and autogenic pressure. The activation was done with NaOH in presence of cetiltrimetilamonium bromide (CTAB). The zeolite NaP-GIS crystals, synthesized from the Quiquel diatomite gel, are mainly bladed aggregated crystals and those crystallized from the Terao diatomite gel exhibit a triangular like morphology. The synthesized solids were identified by Xray diffraction (XRD) and characterized by scanning electron microscopy- energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1637/770

Stable latices with particle sizes below 46 nm and polymer with high molecular weights (≥ 1 × 106g/mol) were obtained.1H and13C NMR spectra of poly(methyl methacrylate) indicate that polymer with an average syndiotactic configuration between 72 and 78% was obtained; these values are larger than those reported for commercial PMMA. These results are interpreted on the basis that due to the small size of the particles (18 to 45 nm), chain growth takes place in a confined space. As a result of the higher syndiotactic content, the glass transition temperature increased. On the grounds that Tg is increased, the polymers obtained by microemulsion polymerization can be used at higher temperature than the commercial polymers. The structure and/or the electrostatic charge of the surfactant did not affect the extent of syndiotactic configuration.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1638/771

Thermally coupled reactive distillation configurations exhibit a complex structure, with recycle streams, that appear to affect their controllability properties. One potential solution to this problem has been suggested through the operation of complex reactive arrangements under conditions that do not provide minimum energy consumption. The basic idea is that if one changes the operation point, the control properties might change as well. In this work, we analyze the dynamic behavior of two thermally coupled reactive distillation sequences under different operating points, including the one with minimum energy consumption. The control analysis properties are analyzed with the application of the singular value decomposition technique in all frequency domain and closed-loop dynamic responses using standard PI controllers. The results show that the controllability properties of complex reactive distillation sequences may change significantly depending on the selected operation point.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1640/773
