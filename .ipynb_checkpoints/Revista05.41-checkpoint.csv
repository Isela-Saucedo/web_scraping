MOENCH.) IN LABORATORY AND NURSERY ASSAYS WITH TREATED VINASSES OF HYDRATED ETHANOL OF UASB REACTOR,"Vinasse is used in crop fertigation indiscriminately, however, this wastewater generates serious environmental damage as the reduction in crop yield or even its death in the short-term and acidification, decreased oxygenation, increased organic load, accumulation of phenols in soil in the medium and long term. The aim of this study was the fertigation sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) in laboratory (bioassays germination) and growth in nursery treated with hydrated ethanol stillage from a UASB modified, in order to improve its chemical properties and use them to 50, 75% (diluted) and 100% of treated vinasse (TV50, TV75 and TV100 respectively). The raw vinasse (RV) had the lowest percentage of germination in seeds of sweet sorghum in laboratory tests (14% in 8 days) compared to the control treatment where 94% of germinated seeds. Growth of seedlings in the nursery with RV treatment was lower than in other treatments and after 13 days the plants completely stopped growth and died.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1366/605

En este trabajo se propone una modificación al método tradicional de extracción de aceite por medio del uso de ultrasonido y solventes; este método incluye la metodología de la separación de clorofila de la fase oleosa. Se evaluaron los perfiles de ácidos grasos por medio de cromatografía de gases-masa (MS-CG) a partir del perfil de los metil ésteres de ácidos grasos (FAME) obtenidos por sonotransesterificación, la composición de ácidos grasos observada fue: palmítico, 28.86; esteárico, 28.33; oleico, 16.79; linoleico, 11.71 y linolénico, 14.31%; composición que no se modificó por el efecto del estrés por nitrógeno. Finalmente, se utilizó la metodología de superficie de respuesta (RSM) para encontrar las mejores condiciones del proceso de extracción en función de la cantidad de solvente utilizado (X1), tiempo de sonicación (X2) y potencia acústica (X3), utilizando sonicación con pulsos y sin pulsos. Las mejores condiciones para el proceso fueron: X1= 5 mL g−1, X2= 6 h y X3 = 160 W, y un proceso sin pulsos; dichas condiciones aseguran una eficiencia de extracción de 94.98%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1367/606

The physical and chemical properties of J. cinerea seeds, collected from its natural habit, were evaluated. The length-, diameter- and weight- of seeds were in the ranges of 8 to 12 mm, 7.5 to 11 mm, and 0.2 to 0.7 g, respectively. Additionally, the amount of oil in the seed kernel was 65.77 wt.%, and it contained 15% saturated, 33% monounsaturated, and 51% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The major constituent (50.8 wt%) of crude J. cinerea oil was linoleic acid. Based on its content of phorbol esters (0.22 mg g−1), J. cinerea was considered to be a non-toxic Jatropha species. Iodine, saponification, and acid values of the J. cinerea seed oil were similar to those of the J. curcas seeds oil; therefore, it was suggested that J. cinerea oil had the quality required for biodiesel production from J. cinerea seeds oil was produced by a sonotransesterification process, evaluating the effect of the methanol: oil molar ratio (MOR), temperature, and reaction time. The best conditions for biodiesel production were 25°C, a MOR of 4:1, and a notably short reaction time of 20 s. These conditions were very advantageous as compared to those required by conventional processes, and very promising for the development of a low cost biodiesel production process using J. cinerea seed oil as a feedstock.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1370/608

In this process the ratio of the initial substrate concentration (Cpb0) to the initial biomass (X0) has been shown to influence the cell yield. This paper presents a study of the effect of the Cpb0/X0ratio on observed cell yield (Yobs) in a fixed bed batch system (microcosm) using a gaseous carbon source, as an approximation to its application in the fungal biofiltration of hydrophobic VOCs. Essays were carried out in fixed-bed microcosms using the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani as a biological agent and n-pentane as a carbon and energy source. The results indicated that Yobs in the gas phase is inversely proportional to the Cpb0/X0ratio, with values of 0.9 to 0.35 gbiomass g-1pentanbeing obtained when the Cpb0/X0ratio is changed from 0.1 to 1.0 gpentane g-1biomass. The results indicate that more than 60% of n-pentane was consumed due to energy spilling, and that strong dissociation of catabolism from anabolism occurred at higher Cpb0/X0ratios.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1371/609

In the aqueous phase system, a (+)-nootkatone production rate up to 3.98 mg L−1h−1was achieved, obtaining a final product concentration of 398.08 mg L−1with a bioconversion of 62 %. A two liquid phase system, using orange essential oil as the dispersed phase, was also studied and a final (+)-nootkatone concentration of 310.37 mg L−1was achieved in the organic phase, with a bioconversion of 30.5 % and a production rate of 2.46 mg L−1day−1. The lower performance obtained using the two phase system was probably due to mass transfer limitations. The present work is the first report on an MABR for the bioconversion of (+)-valencene to (+)-nootkatone. Further studies on bioconversion products and optimization of biofilm reactor operations are needed to enhance bioconversion.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1372/610

The WS was pretreated by alkaline-peroxide. Enzymatic complex Accellerase 1500T Mwas used for hydrolysis assays. Using response surface methodology, optimal parameter values were determined. A complete enzymatic kinetic of the hydrolysis reaction was obtained in 10 h. The optimal value of reducing sugars concentration (RSC), given by the model, was 5.97 mg/mL and the corresponding yield was 61.73%. The maximum yield for the WS hydrolysis was 61.73% and was achieved at a temperature of 52.0°C, pH 4.6, and a E/SRof 2.1 mL of Accellerase 1500T M/g of cellulose. The S RV was 4.80 U/mg and was obtained with the following conditions: pH 5.0, temperature of 48.5°C and an E/SRof 0.19 mL/g. A quadratic polynomial equation for predicting the hydrolysis yield was developed. The confirmation experiment showed a final value for RSC of 5.98 ± 0.81 mg/mL. This result indicates a % error of 0.33. The experimental results were in good agreement with predicted value.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1377/613

Results showed that when enzymatic hydrolysate containing 79.5 g L−1of glucose and 8.81 g L−1of acetic acid, a maximum ethanol yield of 92% and a productivity of 1.16 g L−1h−1were obtained, with a total of 37 g L−1of ethanol after 27 h. Acetic acid concentration present in enzymatic hydrolysates was the main factor that contributed to decrease ethanol yield and productivity, in the case of hydrolysate E, where acetic acid concentration was higher (12.8 g L−1), ethanol yield and productivity were 80% and 0.99 g L−1h−1respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1378/614

Diets with fish meal and different bean flour concentrations (15, 30 and 45%) and control diet were developed. The results show that the bean flour present in the diets has an effect (p < 0.05) on expansion index (EI), bulk density (BD), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI) and sinking velocity (SV). Extrusion moisture decreased (p < 0.05), EI, WSI and the color parameters L* and b*, but increased (p ¡0.05), BD, SV, WAI, and the color parameter a*. The results also showed that an increase on extrusion temperature decreased (p < 0.05), EI, BD, WSI, SV, color and increased (p < 0.05), WAI. The highest (p < 0.05) EI was found in the extruded diet containing 15% of bean flour, 18% extrusion moisture and extruded at 120 °C, compared to other diets. The lowest (p < 0.05) SV was determined in the extruded diets with less than 30% bean flour and an extrusion moisture of 18%. The optimum extrusion conditions were found with diets containing 15% of bean flour and extruded with 18% moisture at 120 °C.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1360/600

Sodium alginate (SA), xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum were used as gelling agents of MAE, and it was found that SA produced inner aqueous phase with enhanced viscoelastic properties, resulting in a W1/O primary emulsion with more uniform mean droplet size and distribution than when using the other gelling agents or ungelled MAE. Subsequently W1/O/W2double emulsions were produced containing MAE gelled with SA or ungelled in the inner aqueous phase stabilized using pure gum Arabic (GA) or a blend of GA-mesquite gum (MG) in a 70:30 ratio in the outer aqueous phase. The double emulsion formulated with gelled MAE and 70:30 GA-MG blend exhibited more uniform mean inner water and outer oil droplet sizes, and protected best the anthocyanins contained in MAE to preserve its color when exposed to 8 h sunlight, providing a half-time life (t1/2) of 55.23 h. The double emulsion formulated with ungelled MAE and stabilized with pure GA displayed a t1/2of 7.40 h.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1362/601

Creaming index (CI), particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ζ) were selected as response variables. The estimated optimal conditions were found at GA of 40%, MD/surfactant mixture of 60%, 30% AT, pH of 4.9, P of 76 MPa and five cycles of microfluidization for a predicted CI of 0.5 % at 24 h with a PS of 384 nm. Under these conditions the experimental results were 437 nm and 0.5 CI.

In recent years, nanoemulsions have been used as delivery systems to improve the bioavailability of lipophilic bioactive compounds. In this work response surface methodology (RSM) by a central composite design was employed to evaluate the effects of emulsification power, ultrasonication time, emulsifier concentration in the characteristics of betulinic acid nanoemulsions. Optimal conditions for nanoemulsions formation were obtained and different emulsifiers and oils as the dispersed phase were studied. The effect of pH on globule size and zeta potential of betulinic acid nanoemulsions was studied. The statistical model used for globule size effectively fitted the experimental data with a R2of 0.94. Operating conditions (power and emulsification time) and the quadratic terms, had significant effects on globule size. The optimal conditions to prepare nanoemulsions with an mean diameter of 64 nm were using 15% emulsifier (tween 60), and an ultrasonication power of 20 W during 220 s. Nanoemulsions prepared with medium chain oil as the dispersed phase had the lowest mean globule size; however, after storage time, nanoemulsions with the mixture medium chain oil:olive oil, the globule size remained unaltered. The pH variation changed the globule surface charge, values from -30 mV were obtained, and after storage time there was no significant change in the zeta potential.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1364/603

Unsaturated fatty acid oxidation in crude avocado oil was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique in the mid infrared region and by quality parameters (acidity, peroxide and iodine). The electric field caused minimal changes on unsaturated fatty acid of avocado oils, then is a suitable method to preserve the crude oil composition of avocado with minimal modifications during a long storage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1365/604

The catalysts were characterized by HRTEM, SEM-EDX and FT-IR of adsorbed NO to determine if the location and dispersion of the WS2particles is changed after the activation of the catalyst, and what consequences this has on the catalyst activity during the HDS of gasoil. W-2.7 catalyst showed a higher concentration and homogeneous distribution of the WS2structures on the external surface of the zeolite support, and a decreased amount within the zeolite cavities with respect to W-11. The catalyst prepared at pH=2.7 exhibited higher activity in the HDS of gasoil. The characterization results indicate that because of the size of the sulfur molecules present in the gasoil, their hydrodesulfurization occurs mainly on the external surface of the zeolite, where this catalyst displays a superior dispersion of the WS2species.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1388/618

In this study it was found that the oscillation frequencies and the pattern reaction fronts, in this case cell type, decrease when the amount of impurities increases. This occurs mainly because the adsorption of O2from gas phase decreases and the diffusion process of adsorbed CO is delayed. Thus oscillations and spatial patterns disappear when the amount of impurities on the substrate is greater than 15 %.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1389/619

We propose a mathematical model using the CFD tool, with which velocity fields comparable to those reported in the literature for a bioreactor with the same geometry as the one studied were obtained. By experimentation the time of mixing and the residence time distribution (RTD) were determined in the operating condition of the bioreactor (without aeration), and a flow pattern of perfect mix for the liquid phase was obtained. Also the mixing time was determined by CFD reaching a good approximation to that obtained experimentally. The operation of the bioreactor with air was characterized using a factorial experimental design 32and the results obtained showed that the coefficient of volumetric oxygen transfer (kLa) depends on the variables stirring speed (N) and air flow rate (Qa). Using published correlations in the literature it was concluded that the phenomenon of flooding of the impeller occurs in the operating condition.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1390/620

The method presented is based on the use of Green’s functions for the solution of the linear problem. However, different analytical solution approaches can lead to identical expressions for the solution; some of these results are compared and discussed. The numerical solution for the nonlinear case relies on the use of an iterative procedure. At this point, it is evident that the main drawback of the method proposed for the solution of the nonlinear transient problem is the infinite Fourier series that represent the Green’s function. For such reason, the presented method is also used to obtain fluid and pellet concentration profiles for the quasi-steady state and steady-state cases. The resulting expressions for such two simpler cases are used to predict the concentration profiles that are also compared with those resulting from the numerical solution of the problem using finite differences. The good agreement of the predictions indicates that more compact expressions for the Green’s function will improve the efficiency of the new numerical scheme.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1391/621

For this purpose, three types of physicochemically modified starches from native starch were synthesized: Phosphated, crosslinked and pregelatinized. Based on a standardized experimental test, the removal efficiency of turbidity and color in representative samples of Tabasco’s surface waters with an initial turbidity of 400 UNT was evaluated. The results referred to the level of turbidity removal showed no significant difference between the use of native starch compared to modified starches. In this regard, the maximum turbidity removal was 95% using 15 mg/L of native starch combined with 35 mg/L of Al2(SO4)3. On the other hand, the maximum color removal of 99.2% was reached by using 25 mg/L of phosphated starch with 25 mg/L of sulfate. Accordingly, this study suggests that the use of environmentally friendly agents based on taro starches would reduce the amount of Al2(SO4)3typically used in the coagulation-flocculation process in water treatment plants.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1392/622

Drying kinetics modeling and the influence of the operation conditions on the shrinkage, microstructure and biosorption capability of Pb+2were studied. Drying kinetics was carried out at 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C. Six semi-empirical models were tested and diffusion approach model provided the best fits. Effective diffusivity varied from 3.73×10−9to 6.99×10−9m2s−1, for untreated slabs (UT) and from 3.65×10−9to 7.74×10−9m2s−1for treated samples (T) with hydrochloric acid. Activation energy was found to be 21.22 and 23.89 kJ/mol for UT and T samples respectively. Shrinkage and the microstructure changes of T slabs were larger than UT samples. T samples dried at 70 and 80 °C showed a reduction in their Pb+2biosorption capability, caused by a large shrinkage and severe microstructural changes. For UT samples their biosorption capability was increased in relation with increase of the shrinkage and drying temperature. T samples dried at 50 and 60 °C improved their biosorption capability of Pb+2, while UT samples dried at 70 and 80 °C showed a better biosorption capability. These results can be useful for preparation of biosorbents.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1394/623

Mechanisms and diffusion paths for several materials have already been established. However, the use of sintering powders to repair fissures on solid materials has rarely been studied. The aim of this work is to study the solid state sintering of copper powders filling artificial grooves in a bar of solid copper. Sintering was carried out in an electrical furnace under H2and Ar (10-90 respectively) atmosphere at two different temperatures, 1000 and 1050°C. The powder used to fill the grooves was a spherical atomized copper powder with a wide particle size distribution, 0-63 µm. Sintering of particles was evaluated at the edge of the solid bar and at the center of the groove by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that particles sintered well on the wall’s surface at the site of the artificial groove. Greater densification reached by the smaller particles and higher sintering temperatures creates defects inside the groove. Those defects are the consequence of the constraints of sintering, and the necks developed during the thermal cycle could be broken by the higher stresses generated during densification.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1404/629

Cellulose nanoparticles were obtained from dried agave leaves by acid hydrolysis. The characterization of the nanoparticles was made using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fast Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The nanoparticles had an average size of 97 ± 30 nm within a range of 31-198 nm, with a quasi-spherical and polyhedral morphology associated to a shape factor of 0.78 ± 0.06. The FTIR results revealed that the cellulose nanoparticles showed the characteristic cellulose peaks. Meanwhile, ssNMR showed the main peaks of the cellulose there was a difference in the peaks presence and absence when comparing to the cellulose pattern, which was associated to a lower crystallinity of the agave nanoparticles. In addition, the nanoparticles had a triclinic crystalline structure and a crystallinity index of 39% confirmed by HR-TEM and XRD. This study is important for a facile obtention of green nanomaterials from agroindustrial waste.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1405/631

The range of the coefficient of performance operations was from 0.21 to 0.39. This model used: inlet temperature in the generator which comes from the absorber, outlet temperature in the absorber that comes from the generator, inlet temperature in the absorber that comes from the generator, water-lithium bromide solution inlet concentration in the generator that comes from the absorber and the pressure in the absorber and generator. A polynomial model is presented in order to obtain coefficient of performance prediction with a determination coefficient of 0.9919. Level surfaces of the coefficient of performance against the inlet variables for the polynomial model and residual analysis were presented with the aim of validating the model. This work has the purpose of providing faster and simpler solutions instead of the complex equations used for the analysis of the heat transformer in order to obtain accurate coefficient of performance prediction. The operation variable with the greater contribution of determination coefficient is presented.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1414/633

The control approach is based on simple step response models and a favorable choice of the discharge flow-rate from the settler as the manipulable variable. Based on simple first order model and first order model plus input delay to account for dead-times induced by the measurement of COD two controllers are derived. The proposed controllers are composed by two parts: (i) an uncertainty observer to compensate uncertainties and neglected terms in the input-output models, and (ii) an inverse dynamics feedback controller. Numerical simulations show good closed-loop performance and robustness properties.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1415/634

It is produced at broiler chicken farms for use it as biomassic fuel for to implement the bioenergetic technology most profitable (anaerobic digestion, anaerobic co-digestion, or direct combustion). The adequate control variables like external temperature (°C), stay days, density per square meter, extractors, foggers, shading, handling, coverage, lining, feeder, watering, fans, area, improving quality of poultry litter and in consequently is reduced the moisture content. These variables are used for the development of artificial neural network (ANN), to control the system that affects the moisture content in the poultry litter. The results of model artificial intelligence show that the variables that most impact the moisture content of the poultry litter are handling, number of extractors, and density per square meter, control contributes to improving conditions the production of farm and reduce the percentage moisture content of less than 25%. By using Montecarlo Simulation, it is performed a risk analysis that includes the results of artificial neural network whose best economic alternative is the bioenergy generation through direct combustion.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1418/636

The research is based on analyzing the influence of six operational and controllable parameters of the experimental setup such as the compressor frequency of operation, the degree of static superheat, and the temperature of the secondary fluids (at the inlet of the evaporator and the condenser) on the exergy destruction. Thus, the results show that most exergy destruction is located in the condenser, followed by the compressor, the expansion valve and the evaporator. Furthermore, the highest exergetic efficiency is obtained by a decrease in the temperature of the secondary fluid inside the evaporator, and by an operation of the compressor at low speed. The efficiency of the compressor is also included in the analysis, which is a parameter that determines the exergy destruction of the largest component. Finally, a function of the exergetic efficiency is established in order to find those magnitudes of operational parameters that contribute to improving this efficiency.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1419/637
