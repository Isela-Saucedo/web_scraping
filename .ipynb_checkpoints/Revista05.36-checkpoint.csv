Model predictions are supported by a series of experiments measuring mycelial growth under different glucose concentrations in the agar plates, as well as the use of a two-carbon sources mixtures. Besides measurements of biomass, CO2 production and O2 consumption were also continuously measured in the gas-phase of a modified Petri dish. Atkinson’s energy charge (1969) concept is used to analyze the growth efficiency under increasing glucose concentration in the agar plates in the range: 25 to 250 gL-1.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1451/653

It was found that after inoculation, and after 0.8 h, the microbial growth was noticed by IS, inferred by the λ parameter. In contrast, by means of the Plate Counting method, the growth was noticed after 6.8 h. The experimental data obtained by IS were first fitted by an RC series circuit, and then, the curves generated were modeled by the well-known growing models of Gompertz and Boltzmann. When using the IS technique, it was found that the resistance of the medium was a better parameter to describe the growing process of La.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1453/655

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of acetic acid and sodium chloride concentrations in pickling solutions, and processing time on stability, quality, and mass transfer parameters of piqu´ın pepper. Model equations were developed for solute gain (SG), WL/SG ratio, water activity (aw), pH, firmness and color index (CI) of piquin pepper. Pickled piquin pepper gained pickling solutes (up to 7.9%) and water (-WL), producing WL/SG values up to -15. In comparison with fresh pepper, pickled pepper firmness decreased between 2 and 59Color changed from bright green to different tones of olive green (CI from -0.8 to -1.8). Pickling of piquin pepper during 15 days in 2.8% acetic acid and 13% sodium chloride gave the best stability parameters (aw = 0.933 and pH = 3.0)",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1442/648

In this work, the phenolic content and antioxidant properties of cocoa extracts prepared by maceration and ultrasound-assisted extraction were studied. The polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activity was estimated by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (Ferric reducing/antioxidant power) assays. The identification and quantification of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that by using ultrasonic radiation, it was possible to obtain higher polyphenol contents from both the husk and cotyledon of cocoa. Furthermore, extracts obtained by sonication showed the highest antioxidant activity, thus proving that this activity depends directly on the total phenolic content. The contents of (+)-catechin and (-)- epicatechin were higher in the cotyledon extracts compared to those of the husk.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1446/649

The fermentation is crucial to the final characteristics of tepache and there is a certain degree of ignorance of related organisms and the level of acceptance among consumers. In this study, tepache fermentation conditions (concentration of sugars, initial pH, temperature and fermentation time) were evaluated to enable correlating the formation of products of fermentation (lactic, acetic and ethanol) with the degree of acceptance of the beverage among consumers. Sensory evaluation was measured on a 9-point hedonic scale. Results were analyzed using the response surface methodology (RSM) which showed that the fermentation conditions for higher acceptance were: 22oC, 10% (mass/volume) of sugars (brown sugar), 72 h of fermentation and an initial pH of 5. According to this study, to have a wider acceptance the beverage must contain about 7 g/L of ethanol, no more than 5 g/L of lactic and acetic acid, and 70 g of sucrose/L. Likewise, yeasts present in the fermentation were identified and it was found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the predominant species",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1447/651

Sorption isotherms for both types of products were determined at the water activity (aw) range of 0.103-0.892, at 15, 25 and 35 oC, by using the gravimetric method with saturated salt. The percentage of retention of AA was determined, after 15, 30, 45 and 60 days of storage at 25 oC. SEM micrographs of the products were obtained and the volume of micropores was also calculated. The minimum integral entropy of the water molecules occurred at aw = 0.234 in the falling drop method powders, whereas this parameter was observed at aw = 0.706 for the atomised one. For both types of products, the maximum value of AA retention was observed at the aw corresponding to the minimum integral entropy which occurred at higher moisture contents for SAA than for IAA materials",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1449/652

In atmospheric conditions the naturally formed aluminum oxide layer can be destroyed by the presence of chlorides, causing pitting localized corrosion attack, difficult for evaluation. The concepts of fractal geometry and self-similarity were used in this study for evaluation of the pitting corrosion as a function of time, making a statistics of the frequency of appearance of pits versus the area occupied by them. The data showed that the distribution of the pits follows a power law. The exponent of self-similarity varied between 1.7-1.9 and it is relatively stable with the progress of corrosion progress. The progress of pits in area and frequency is more pronounced in time in the marine-coastal atmosphere, compared to pitting developed in rural- urban one. The concepts of fractal geometry and self-similarity can quantify the extent of localized corrosion with time, as nondestructive form and rapid method.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1455/657

Catalysts were characterized by: physical adsorption N2 (BET), XRD, UV-VIS, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, FTIR of the CO adsorption, XPS and TPO. The results showed a decrease in the number of acid sites with the loading of Ce in the catalyst. It was observed higher dispersion on Pd than on Pt catalysts. For Pt catalysts only Pt0 species was detected while in palladium catalysts Pd0 and Pd2+ species were observed. For both series of catalysts total combustion was reached on the catalysts containing 1% of Ce, Pt/ACe1, and Pd/ACe1 catalysts, at 300oC. For Pd catalysts the maximum in activity depended on the redox optimal ratio (Ce3+ / Ce4+ and Pd0/ Pd2+) and the activation time for the catalyst was important. The catalytic combustion of toluene on Pt was favored on reduced surface through a process of demethylation. The depot of carbon on catalyst decreased with Ce contents due to redox properties of the cerium oxide.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1458/658

Omeprazole used in the experiments of degradation was obtained by the process of solid-liquid extraction from a generic brand commercial medicament. The degradation experiments were carried out in a reactor illuminated with low energy UV light lamps using TiO2 Degussa P25 as catalyst. The experimental results indicate that the organic compound is easily degraded in a very short period of time. However, the omeprazole molecule is not mineralized in a rapid manner. In the same way as other aromatic compounds, omeprazole is transformed to other organic compounds before being mineralized to CO2 and water.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1459/660

At all initial pOHBD concentrations tested (25-400 mg C/L), both ammonium (100 mg NH+4- N/L) and pOHBD were consumed with efficiencies of 99:2 ± 1:5 % and 100 ± 1 %, respectively. At pOHBD concentrations lower than 100 mg C/L, the main product of ammonium oxidation was nitrate with a yield (YNO3) of 0:97 ± 0:03 g NO3-N/g NH+4-N consumed. At 200 and 400 mg pOHBD-C/L, YNO3decreased to 0:78 ± 0:05 and nitrite was detected (YNO2= 0:04 ± 0:01 g NO2-N/g NH+4-N consumed). p-Hydroxybenzoate (pOHBT) was detected as product of pOHBD oxidation. pOHBT accumulation was significant in the first operation cycles at 25 mg pOHBD-C/L. Afterward, pOHBT was completely removed and no aromatic intermediates were detected. At low C/N ratio values (0.25-4), a dissimilatory nitrifying respiratory process was maintained (YBM= 0:03  ± 0:01 g biomass-N/g NH+4-N consumed). These results show that nitrifying SBR can be successfully used for the simultaneous removal of ammonium and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde in a unique reactor. This information might be useful for treating industrial wastewaters contaminated with nitrogen and recalcitrant phenolic compounds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1461/661

The method is based on the calculation of the first derivative of the velocity profiles. For this, the velocity profiles of a model yield stress fluid, 0.2 wt.% Carbopol gel, in a capillary were obtained by using a two dimensional particle image velocimetry system. It is shown that the yield stress value may be reliably determined by using only the velocity profiles and the measured wall shear stresses. This fact is corroborated by independent measurements of the yield stress with a stress controlled vane rheometer. On the other hand, the main details of the flow kinematics of yield-stress fluids were also registered and described in this work. Finally, it was found that the gel slips at the wall with a slip velocity that increases in a power-law way with the shear stress",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1469/668

Response surface methodology was chosen in this work for designing experiments. Chromium coatings were obtained from trivalent solutions in a chloride-based bath using different operating conditions. Three concentrations (0.19, 0.38 and 0.57 mol L-1as Cr(III) ), three pH (2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) and temperature (25°C, 32°C, 40°C) was varied during the experiments. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used for examining the coatings surface morphology and composition; the coulometric method was used for thickness measurement and potentiodynamic and impedance tests on 3% NaCl were made on a three-electrode cell for studying chromium film electrochemical behavior. Large differences in morphology, thickness and corrosion resistance were observed, mainly due to variations in chromium concentration and pH solution. Crack patterns were observed on films obtained at high pH values independently of process temperature",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1471/669

The cellulose whiskers (microfibrils) were obtained from banana rachis and pseudostem Musa cavendish. Changes in thermal, structural and mechanical properties, due to degradation processes of PLA-CW, were studied using DSC, IR Spectroscopy, XRD, NMR, GPC and Mechanical test. The results show that the percentage of biodegradability in soil, based on CO2 release, is higher for samples of PLA-CW that have been previously exposed to UV-photodegradation, which induces hydrolysis that stimulates the biodegradability of PLA-CW. The results indicate that PLA-CW has short half-life after biodegradation in soil and it is suitable  for land disposal",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1479/677

This proposal, intended for engineering purposes, is capable of reducing computational time to facilitate, even with analytic solutions, the kinetics description, especially when more complex systems are being studied. In spite of the model’s simplicity, fundamental kinetic parameters, including the reaction order and the rate constant, (composed of the Arrhenius constant and the activation energy) can be determined in the diffusion free zone. A four-parameter model accurately described the previously reported conversion evolution of a cyanate ester resin, from 140 to 190° C, presented as a case example. For the limit conversion and the Churchill- Usagi exponent, a linear dependence with reaction temperature was obtained",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1482/678

Different concentrations of glycerol and nanoclay (Sodium montmorillonite) were evaluated using response surface analysis, determining that glycerol is the factor that has influence on the mechanical and barrier properties of the films. However, when there is a combination of high montmorillonite with low glycerol concentration, the properties were improved, resulting rigid films with better properties.
