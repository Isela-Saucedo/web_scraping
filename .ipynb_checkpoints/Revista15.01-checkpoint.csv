Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Metamorphic- tectonic implications under a compression dynamic in Cangre Belt, western of Cuba","The Cangre Belt is located in western Cuba, where it belongs to the Mesozoic basement of the Island. The belt contains three tectonic units: Pino Solo, Mestanza and Cerro de Cabras, each one overthrusted upon the Alturas de Pizarras del Sur unit of the Guaniguanico terrane. This tectono-metamorphic scenario contrasts with the remaining parts of the terrane. The conclusions arrived in this paper are supported by cartographic, petrographic, and structural data, collected during decades, that also includes mineral chemistry content in the micas from the siliciclasts. The clockwise rotation of the main compressive stress σ1developed with singular time-spatial consequences that allow to discriminate several deformational periods (P) from NW 330°–340° up to NE 20°–30° during P1 compression and the development of tectonic transport (P2 and P4). The sinistral Pinar fault (P3) conditioned the birth and tectonic style of the belt from a small change in its trend, provoking transpression in some sector and the development of a positive flower structure (extrusive orogen) and its definite configuration during the last deformation period (P4). In these tectonic conditions occurs some metamorphic processes: mc-very low degree metamorphism, related to cleavage, developed during all periods, mt-transpressive metamorphism of low degree, progressive related to mid pressure-high part (P4 with the highest P/T gradients) and me-metamorphism by tectonic extrusion, of low degree, retrograde with mid pressure-middle part (P4). The juxtaposed emplacement of the extrusive sequences conditioned their metamorphic heterogeneities.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1632/1443
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Pleistocene volcanism along the margins of the Canal de Ballenas transform fault, Gulf of California","Pleistocene subaerial volcanism along the margins of the Ballenas Channel, northern Gulf of California, is represented by two morphologically young dacite dome complexes exposed at the opposite edges of sheared continental crust: Isla Coronado in coastal Baja California, and the Lobera volcanic complex in west-central Isla Ángel de la Guarda. Single crystal zircon U-Pb crystallization ages of Coronado and Lobera volcanoes range betweenca.250 and 1000 ka, indicating maximum ages for the eruptions. Eruption ages are directly constrained by an40Ar/39Ar whole-rock age of 692 ± 164 ka for one of the lava units in the Lobera volcanic complex. Trace elements in Pleistocene zircon indicate continental affinity, which supports radiogenic (Nd, Sr) isotopic data that were modeled using different mixing and AFC scenarios indicating a MORB-type primary magma with significant (~10–20 %) crustal assimilation involving tonalitic basement of the eastern Peninsular Ranges Batholith.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1659/1444
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Petrology and geochemistry of the orthogneisses outcropping in the eastern and central regions in the Santander Massif, Colombian Andes","Orthogneisses outcropping in the central and eastern regions in the Santander Massif consist in interlayered of hornblende gneiss, biotite gneiss and quartzo–feldspathic gneiss. Biotite and hornblende gneisses are the predominant lithologies. In these orthogneisses, sporadic amphibolite lenses appear. The orthogneisses are the result of the synthectonic emplacement of granitoids in the rocks of the Silgará Schist Unit during the metamorphic peak of this meta–sedimentary unit. Some structural and compositional differences are observed in the orthogneisses of the central and eastern sectors; the most developed foliation is observed in the central sector and the presence of muscovite, apparently it is restricted only to the eastern sector. The geochemical characteristics show that the orthogneisses of the central sector are granitic in composition, while, for those located in the eastern sector, their composition varies between granite and granodiorite. These orthogneisses were formed on an active continental margin. According to rare earth elements – REE behavior the rocks displayed three geochemical trends: 1) The felsic orthogneisses are moderating depleted in Light Rare elements–LREE (La–Sm) and depleted in Heavy Rare Earth elements–HREE (Eu–Lu); 2) negative europium anomaly is typical for orthogneisses; 3) Amphibolite is depleted in LREE and slow increment of HREE without europium anomaly. P–T metamorphic conditions were estimated for the central region as T = 690–770 °C and P = 0.53–0.85 GPa whereas amphibolite from eastern region reached metamorphic thermal peak conditions at T = 680–693 °C. Occurrence, field relationship of studied orthogneisses respect to metasedimentary country rocks are very similar that those orthogneisses outcropping along the Andes and southeastern terranes of Mexico as result of magmatic arc developed along the Western Gondwana protomargin.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1652/1446

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Diversity of Crinozoa (Echinodermata: Eocrinoidea, Blastoidea, Crinoidea) from the Paleozoic of Mexico","Paleozoic outcrops in Mexico containing echinoderms are located to the north, center and south of the country, mainly in the states of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Hidalgo, Puebla, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. These rocks correspond to marine carbonates deposited in warm shallow environments, with an approximate age of 541 to 251 Ma. Also containing a varied and diverse biota made up of phylloid algae, foraminifera (fusulinids), coralline sponges, corals, bryozoans, brachiopods, mollusks, trilobites and echinoderms. In order to know the diversity of Crinozoa from the Paleozoic of Mexico, an analysis of the species documented for the country was carried out, with the objective of contributing to the knowledge of the biostratigraphy and paleogeography of Mexico. The methodology consisted of a detailed analysis of bibliographic sources with information on echinoderms from the Paleozoic of Mexico. Cambrian eocrinoids (Gogia, and Ubaghsicystis)are distributed mainly in Sonora. Crinoid plates from the Carboniferous and Permian, particularly morphospecies of the generaCyclocaudex,Cyclocrista,Heterostelechus,Lamprosterigma,Mooreanteris,Pentagonopternix,Preptopremnum, andPentaridica, are widely distributed throughout the country. Analysis of the Mississippian-Permian biota indicates that the cosmopolitan distribution of the fauna studied in this work is due to the connections between the seas of western North America and eastern Asia. The Late Permian benthic fauna of Sonora was widely dispersed in the Tethyan realm, which stretched from western North America to North Africa and Asia. The comprehensive study of Paleozoic marine stratigraphic successions and their biotic content provided information on faunal migrations regarding the Paleozoic carbonate facies. It also contributed to reconstructing the geographical, climatological, and ecological characteristics of the Paleozoic of Mexico.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1665/1447
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Evolution and geomorphological dynamics of the Amarillo River basin, Famatina system (La Rioja, Argentina)","The analysis of the different features that characterize a landscape is an essential requirement to know the geomorphological evolution, having a great impact on the productive development of a region, knowing the positive and negative aspects that can affect or enhance them. For this, it is necessary to recognize, characterize and classify the morphologies present, which account for the factors and processes that acted in their formation, and contribute to the interpretation and reconstruction of the evolution of the relief at various scales. The Amarillo river basin is located in the Sierra de Famatina, which is located in the center-north of the province of La Rioja, in northwestern Argentina. Office and field tasks were carried out in order to analyze, recognize and identify the main geomorphological features present, and establish their spatial arrangement. In the highest sectors of the basin, geoforms associated with glacial, periglacial and gravitational processes stand out, caused by low temperatures, steep slopes and lack of vegetation. Fluvial forms, both accumulation and erosion, were identified throughout the analysed area, while lacustrine deposits are described where it is interpreted that their formation was associated with the global arid event defined as the Meghalayan Stage. This distribution and typology of geoforms, conditioned by tectonics and exogenous processes, led to a complex geomorphological evolution in the Quaternary of the Amarillo river basin.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1637/1448

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Definition of the stress-deformation field and seismotectonics of the Morelia-Acambay fault system, Mexico","The Morelia-Acambay Fault System (MAFS) is located in the central-western part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). The MAFS is a 30 km wide-transtensional shear zone made up of E-W and ENE-WSW oriented faults. Since middle Miocene (7–9 Ma), the seismotectonics of this fault system has controlled the evolution of E-W tectonic depressions (Zacapu, Cuitzeo, Morelia, and Acambay), and the lacustrine environments. This paper describes the spatial variation of the state of recent deformation through the structural analysis of fault populations measured in the field and the definition of the regional stress regime from the analysis of the focal mechanisms of shallow intraplate earthquakes.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1688/1450
