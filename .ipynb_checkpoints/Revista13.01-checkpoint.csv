Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Classification of the flood severity of the Guadalquivir River in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th to 19th centuries,"This study estimates the flood severity between the 13th and 19th centuries on the southwestern Iberian Peninsula based on the historic records of impacts of the Guadalquivir River flooding on the city of Seville (Spain). The main documentary source wasHistoria crítica de las riadas o grandes avenidas del Guadalquivir en Sevilla(Critical history of the floods of the Guadalquivir in Seville) (1878), which compiles news from different observers that were contemporaries of each flood. Regarding the methodology, it was necessary to transfer the information from different documentary sources to ordinal indices, which required developing allocation criteria per flood impact. From the annual severity index assigned to the different floods, an interannual series was generated. Through interannual weighing of the flooding indices, it was possible to deduce the durations and intensities of sequences of flood periods between 1250 and 1850. Of the 10 floods classified as most destructive during the five centuries analyzed (i.e., from 1280 to 1880), five occurred during little more than a century (1598-1701). The obtained results contribute to knowledge on regional rainfall, as well as to historical climatology and hydrology, over multiple centuries.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Behavior of the ITCZ second band near the Peruvian coast during the 2017 coastal El Niño,"The behavior of the second band of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) near the Peruvian coast during early 2017 is studied, using precipitation, surface winds, sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric variables in different isobaric levels. The proposal of a daily index (Ia) to identify opportunely the formation of this band and the Lorenz energy terms in the region is also considered. This band was present from late January to early April 2017, associated with an anomalous dipole of sea level pressure between the east and west eastern Equatorial Pacific that configured anomalously northerly surface winds and the release of southeasterly trade winds near Peru. In medium levels, a zonally oriented positive mixing ratio anomaly was observed in early March over the ITCZ second band, associated with heavy rain systems over the northern Peruvian coastal region. In the same period, positive anomalies of divergence in high tropospheric levels were observed. The daily Ia index allowed an effective detection of the ITCZ second band 11 days before the maximum coastal precipitation, and the Lorenz energy terms showed eddy kinetic energy (KE) peaks in January and February and a contribution of barotropic instability in equatorial regions.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,"Surface shortwave cloud radiative effect of cumulus and stratocumulus-cumulus cloud types in the Caribbean area (Camagüey Cuba, 2010-2016)","The effects of cumulus (Cu) clouds and the combination of stratocumulus-cumulus (Sc-Cu) clouds on solar radiation at the Earth’s surface were evaluated at Camagüey, Cuba, during a 6-yr period (from June 2010 to May 2016). Two methods to calculate the cloud radiative effect (CRE) were employed. The first method (CREm) uses solar irradiances in cloudy conditions from actinometric observations, where cloud information was also reported by visual observation. In the second method (CRE0) surface solar irradiances were estimated for both cloudy and clear sky conditions using a 1-D radiative transfer model, and cloud optical depth (COD) retrieved from an AERONET sun-photometer as the main input. A temporal correspondence criterion between COD retrievals and actinometric observations was performed in order to classify the COD of each cloud type. After the application of this criterion, the COD belonging to the optically thin clouds was removed. Finally, 255 and 732 COD observations for Cu and Sc-Cu, respectively, were found. Results show a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level between CRE calculated for Sc-Cu and Cu, using both methods. Mean values of CREmand CRE0for Cu (Sc-Cu) were −442 (−390) and −460 (−417) Wm–2, respectively. CRE0shows a linear relation with ln(COD), with stronger correlation at a lower solar zenith angle. The shortwave cloud effect efficiency (CEE) for the two cloud types sharply decreases with the increase of the COD value up to 20. For larger COD, the CEE is less sensitive to the increase of COD.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Summer dry events on synoptic and intraseasonal timescales in the Southeast Region of Brazil,"The occurrence of dry events in the Southeast Region of Brazil (SEB) during summer (rainfall season) has been in evidence in the last years, mainly due to previous extreme events in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons. Drought analyses are usually carried out with monthly data. Here our methodology addresses the issue with daily data to generate a thorough analysis. Dry events were evaluated in different homogeneous precipitation sub-regions within the SEB, over 37 December-February (DJF) seasons and with two different timescales of duration: synoptic (5-9 days) and intraseasonal (≥10 days). Two main distinct dynamic patterns were found for dry events in southern and central-northern parts of SEB, respectively, but no significant differences were identified in the different timescales of occurrence. Southern events were characterized by a stationary ridge acting over the whole of southern South America, making the approximation of the transient system to southern SEB difficult. At the same time, this pattern showed a northern-shifted South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) configuration. In the central-northern events, a high pressure centered between Brazil’s South and Southeast regions was associated with the dryness conditions. An anomalous southward shift of meteorological systems characteristic of the South American summer was also verified for these events. Over the South Atlantic, an opposite SST anomaly configuration was identified between southern and central-northern events.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Connecting heavy precipitation events to outgoing long wave radiation variability scales: Case analysis in Brazil,"Spatial fields of outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) spectrum variance of the 1979-2016 austral summer months in southern Brazil are analyzed on different timescales: synoptic, sub-monthly, and intra-seasonal. Variability fields differ both in intensity and location and highlight dominant convection cycles in the study area. The results show that the amplitude of sub-monthly variability is greater than that of the other scales in the southeastern region of Brazil, while the synoptic scale prevails in the southern region. The above-mentioned scales show greater amplitudes over the western Pacific Ocean where the Madden-Julian Oscillation plays an important role, along the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and over the storm track areas over the South Pacific Ocean. The influence of spectral OLR scale interaction is also analyzed, associated to the occurrence of two intense rainfall events over the southeastern Brazil in the austral summers of 2011 and 2014 when the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) was active in both events. The results obtained suggest that spectral OLR scale interaction takes place in such way that it strengthens the SACZ, since the spatial pattern footprints of the two to eight-day timescale (synoptic), 10 to 30-day timescale (sub-monthly) and 30 to 60-day timescale (intra-seasonal) overlap in the study region.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,"Regional patterns of vegetation, temperature, and rainfall trends in the coastal mountain range of Chiapas, Mexico","Changes in atmospheric CO2, ocean temperature, and regional vegetation conditions in Mesoamerica indicate that significant trends in temperature and rainfall may have occurred in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Mexico. This is an important region for flora and fauna which could be affected by climate trends. We aimed to determine if and where climate trends had occurred in the Sierra Madre and lower elevation regions between 1990 and 2016 (27 years), if these trends were part of longer term (1960-2016 [57 years]) changes, and how changes in large-scale and regional/local conditions may be influencing these trends. In the Sierra Madre, overall minimum daily temperatures increased, maximum temperatures decreased, and the most significant mean temperature trends were cooler during the 27-yr period. Both the start and end of the wet season trended earlier in the year, and wet season rainfall increased significantly. Trends were not significant during the 57-yr period in the Sierra Madre; however, in the adjacent Pacific coast region, significant warmer temperature trends continued during this period. Within regions, there was large variation in temperature and rainfall changes and some local trends were opposite to the regional averages. Large-scale processes of warming sea surface temperatures in the east coast of Mexico, a change from the positive to negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and increases in atmospheric CO2may be influencing these trends. At the regional scale, increases in dense vegetation and evapotranspiration since 1990 may have created characteristics favoring a positive feedback of higher ocean-based moisture and vegetation-based precipitation cycling.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1

The aim of the study was to undertake the agroclimatic zoning across the state in order to determine the type of crops more convenient to render the highest yields, based on Papadakis climate classification system. Hydric and thermal characteristics pertaining to the geographic distribution of crops were used, as well as indexes derived from meteorological data provided by 25 climate stations. There were three climatic groups identified: tropical, subtropical and cold land, having four, three and two subgroups each, respectively. First two climatic groups support winter cereals such as oat (Avena sativaL.), barley (Hordeum vulgareL.), rye (Secale cerealeL.) and wheat (TriticumaestivumL.); and summer cereals such as corn (Zea maysL.), millet (Panicum italicumL.), rice (Oryza sativaL.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor(L.) Moench); in addition to banana (Musa paradisiacaL.), citrus and potato (SolanumtuberosumL.) and sugar cane (Saccharum officinarumL.). On the other hand, corn and potato were found in the cold land climatic group. Based on Papadakis’ methodology, for each climatic sub-group identified, a set of recommendation management were given to improve yields: crop type, sowing season, irrigation, fertilizing and other agrochemicals application; and to avoid crop damage. Agroclimatic zoning map was generated by using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method. This study may contribute to the successful planning of crops across the region and thus improving the state’s economy.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,"Partial COVID-19 lockdown effect in atmospheric pollutants and indirect impact in UV radiation in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a significant decrease in industrial activities and other anthropogenic interventions on the environment, followed by a reduction of the emission of pollutant gases and aerosols. Monitoring of air quality is commonly performed through automatic stations, which can provide nearly real-time, accurate information. However, stations located in urban areas are subject to maintenance problems and extensive coverage for large areas is not feasible. As an alternative approach, data from orbital sensors can provide useful information for large areas at a low cost. Consequently, this study aimed to analyze the partial COVID-19 lockdown effect in atmospheric pollutants and its indirect impact in UV radiation in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Data on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), total ozone (O3), and ultraviolet index (UVI) acquired by the OMI sensor aboard the Aura satellite were accessed for May, for the entire period 2010 to 2018, 2019, and 2020. Differences between these time series were calculated. Results showed significant reductions in NO2in most of the study area by as much as 33.9%, followed by increases in total ozone of up to 3.5% and the UVI by up to 4.8%. Although NO2plays a fundamental role in stratospheric chemistry, our results suggest that its decrease in 2020 was not directly responsible for the increase in total O3; however, NO2was partially the cause for the increase in UVI, which in turn led to the heating of the stratosphere, generating an increase in O3.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Quantification of greenhouse gas emissions of a steel factory in Brazil,"This work aimed to identify and quantify greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of a steel factory, considering the importance of these data in the context of large global GHG emissions. As a result, Scope 1 emissions were identified as the highest in the industry, representing more than 89% of total emissions in CO2eq. This scenario is mainly identified a result of the Brazilian energy matrix configuration, which contributes to reduce Scope 2 emissions. The used methodology (GHG Protocol v. 2018.1.4) proved to be appropriate for calculating emissions within a broader report (annual amount). However, in order to develop an indicator for the organization, with monthly detailed data, it was necessary to adapt the tool, which is the differential of this work.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
Atmósfera,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Ciencias Planetarias y de la Atmósfera,Prediction of atmospheric corrosion from meteorological parameters: Case of the atmospheric basin of the Costa Rican Western Central Valley,"The assessment of atmospheric corrosion is currently based on the study of atmospheric basins (AB). Modeling atmospheric corrosion in many cases involves the measurement of several meteorological and atmospheric pollution parameters, specifically temperature, relative humidity, chloride, and sulfur dioxide, making the estimation process more complex. However, for the Western Central Valley (WCV) in Costa Rica, a low-pollution AB, it is possible to develop simplified atmospheric corrosion models based on a small number of atmospheric parameters. In this paper, the meteorological variables of the study region were analyzed in terms of their dependency on altitude and their applicability in the development of a simplified model to predict the corrosion rate (Vcorr). The output of the predictive model was compared with the standard model of ISO 9223:2012, showing a higher skill and giving reliable results for a wide interval of altitudes.",,http://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/issue/view/36-1
