The gas holdup, liquid velocity, shear rate, flow pattern and volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) were evaluated as a function of the air velocity and medium rheology. Tap water and CMC solutions were used as Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. The standardmodel was employed for modeling turbulence, and unsteady three-dimensional simulations with the Euler–Euler model were performed. Gas holdup, liquid velocity andkLameasurements were performed for validating simulations. An increase in bubble coalescence and a decrease inkLawas observed with CMC solutions. The presence of recirculation loops inside the riser for CMC solutions is reported, which was not observed with tap water. The higher the CMC concentration, the larger the recirculation region seems to be. Results show that recirculation loops play a substantial role in the reactor’s hydrodynamic performance, and it turns out that the gas holdup in the riser increases with increasing the CMC concentration.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2694/1316

To validate the novel model, a full mixed-level experimental design was proposed with two factors: agitation speed and dispersed phase. The model employs the conformable derivate order operator (α) and the electrode constant (kp), which changes with electrode use and the operating conditions of the bioreactor. The results show that when the viscosity increases and the agitation decreases, the valueαincreases, and vice versa. Therefore,αis a parameter that has a physical meaning in the process. The correlation coefficient of the proposed model with the experimental data (R2> 0.985) is higher than the one obtained with conventional models. The Akaike information criterion determined that the proposed conformal model describes the experimental data by 59%, while the conventional models describe the experimental data by 25% and 15%. There are no reports of similar mathematical models that determine mass transfer coefficients in bioprocesses.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2701/1321

Bioleaching experiments were conducted using nativeBacillus cereusMAMPE19 BCG, isolated and characterized from previous research, to test removal of arsenic (As) from actual mining waste. Mineralogical characterization by XRD was performed to identify mineral associations with As. The experimental design included a bioleaching system with agitated flasks (triplicate) and the effects of pH (5, 7, and 9) and pulp density (10, 15, and 20%) were evaluated. Finally, based on the results of the ANOVA, the system that achieved the highest percentage of As dissolution was selected and scaled to a stirred tank bioreactor. The composition of the mineral was mainly calcite (CaCO3), gismondine (CaAl2Si2O8·4(H2O)), akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7), and silicon oxide (SiO2). NativeBacilluscereusdissolved 40.6 ± 4.9 and 37.4 ± 2.7 % of As in 10 d, in agitated flasks at a pH of 5 and a pulp density of 10 and 15%, respectively; and a 27.5 ± 2.9% dissolution of As was achieved in the stirred tank bioreactor at pH 5 and pulp density of 15%, supported by significant statistical differences.","A.M.

The model derivation is based on a series expansion of the system solution in terms of a characteristic time constant. The multi-substrate Monod equation is structurally similar to the single-substrate Monod equation, containing terms that reflect the competitive interactions between the different substrates.

The nonlinear viscoelastic characteristics of the oleogels was conducted by means of large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) methods. To this end, Fourier analysis of the stress-time response was carried out to extract information on high-harmonic oscillatory moduli. The results showed that nonlinearities were expressed for moderate strain deformations, of the order of 1-15%. In particular, nonlinearities quantified in terms of the harmonic contributions were stronger for the elastic response (about 85-125%) than for the viscous response (less than 40%). In contrast, the mechanical response was essentially harmonic for small amplitude values, indicating the absence of nonlinearities and hence the dominance of linear viscoelastic response. Interestingly, the viscoelastic response was also linear for large strain deformation (>100%). The results reported in the present study demonstrated the viability of LAOS method for obtaining invaluable insights regarding the nonlinear mechanical response of edible oleogels made with natural waxes.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2816/1329

However, there is a limitation to using this shrub as a beneficial material, because this shrub had been listed as endangered. Thus, we established an adventitious root culture ofA.distichum(AdAR) to overcome this limitation. Solvent-solvent partition fractions from methanol extract of methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-elicited AdAR were used, and the ethyl acetate fraction of MeJA-treated AdAR (EtOAc/MeJA) exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells. EtOAc/MeJA downregulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and mediators by inhibiting the LPS-activated MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In addition, the results of the phytochemical analysis suggested that MeJA induced the accumulation of polyphenolic compounds, including p-coumaric and ferulic acids, by inducing phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes in AdAR. These results suggested that AdAR is a viable source for overcoming limitations in the industrial use ofA. distichum.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2819/1340

Due to this, valorization of these wastes has been studied, being the production of biofuels a promising option. In particular, rice husks were proposed to produce fuel pellets, buy they do not fulfill the ISO 17225-6 standard due to its elevated ash content; thus, it is required to mix them with other wastes available in the same region. In Mexican states where rice is produced also bean is cultivated, whose residues are not used and have an elevated content of volatile solids. Therefore, the objective of this research is to produce fuel pellets from rice husk and bean straws that meet ISO 17225-6 standard. For this, the densification was carried out using three levels of moisture content and mixing ratios of the biomasses. Based on the experimental data, optimal densification conditions were found through a response surface analysis. Results show that fuel pellets produced from bean straw (90%) and rice husk (10%) with 15.0% of moisture content fulfill ISO 17225-6 standard.  At these conditions, fuel pellets have calorific power of 3,645.78 kcal/kg, 6.98 ash, 9.76% final moisture, 610.78 kg/m3bulk density, and 99.51% durability.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2679/1314

Cuaresmeño (Opuntia matudae) was evaluated. During convection drying, the effect of the temperature (60, 70 and 80 °C) was evaluated, resulting in drying times of 195, 165 and 120 minutes, respectively. The influence of the temperature on the equilibrium humidity was determined through the drying kinetics, which were affected by increasing the temperature from 60 to 80°C. The drying time for the by-product decreased, and equilibrium humidities of 0.04, 0.03 and 0.02 g water/g dry sample were reached for 60, 70 and 80 °C, respectively. Fick's second law was used along the experiments to determine the effective diffusivity, which ranged from 4.788 E-10–8.109 E-10m2/s for the evaluated temperatures. Convective drying at 60°C proved to be a suitable alternative for the conservation of antioxidant capacity (88.07 ± 0.38% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition) compared to drying at 70 and 80°C. These were 8% higher compared to the results for freeze drying. However, convective drying at 60°C is more convenient for the xoconostle by-products due to the cost-benefit ratio.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2692/1318

Jalapeño chili pepper (Capsicum annuumL.) plants were treated with the phytohormones separately (gibberellic acid, 5 mM solution and auxins (2 mL/L solution)) and mixed together. The obtained results indicated that the freeze-drying process significantly preserved the concentration of nutraceutical compounds and antioxidant activity. The individual application of phytohormones led to significant increases in the concentrations of all nutraceutical compounds and antioxidant activity in the jalapeño chili peppers. However, an antagonist effect of the phytohormone mixture on jalapeño chili pepper production was observed, and for this reason, no jalapeño chili pepper samples were obtained. In conclusion, drying and phytohormonal treatment influence the preservation of nutraceutical compounds and antioxidant activity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2719/1320

It provides adequate texture to maize products but implies a high energy input and releases a considerable volume of waste effluent (nejayote). In this work, the effect of temperature (60 and 90 °C) and the addition of nejayote solids, on textural properties and color of corn dough and tortillas, were studied. It was observed that after nixtamalization at 60 °C the textural properties of corn products did not show a significant difference compared to those at 90 °C. Regarding the addition of nejayote solids, the textural and color properties of the dough and tortillas were not modified, neither at 60 nor at 90 °C, obtaining products with the same attributes as the commercial products.

Therefore, it is necessary to look for sustainable alternatives for its production. Cellulases are mainly produced by Aspergillus niger, and their activity can be affected by nitrogen concentration, the use of surfactants, and the carbon source, among others. The objective of this work was to identify enzymes with CMCase and β-glucosidase activity of A. niger ITV-02 from low-cost lignocellulosic residues such as corn and cob stubble in two culture media (M1 and M2). The results showed that using corn stover and medium M2 increased the volumetric activity 1.4 and 1.7 times, respectively compared to corn cob and medium M2. Likewise, enzymes with cellulase activity were identified using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and 4- methyl-lumberyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (MUG). The enzymes identified in MUG correspond to a glucoamylase, two β-glucosidases, and an exo β-xylosidase. In CMC the following were identified: exo-β-1,3-glucanase, endo -β-1,4 xylanase arabinosidase, and endoglucanase.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2772/1335

In the clarification process, the particle size of the feed and the pore size of the membrane give important information about the characteristics and stabilization of the filtered juice. In this work we present an application of a previously reported novel computational simulation used to describe two apple juice filtration systems. Experimental data on the filtration of Golden Delicious (GD) apple juice after two different pre-filtration treatments was obtained and the effect on particle size distribution was studied. The experimental data was compared to the simulation results in which the final mean particle size of filtered juices is determined by the pore size distribution of the membrane and the feed particle size distribution. The error of the simulated values was <10% and therefore the model is valid as a first attempt to provide criteria for membrane selection in the filtration of apple juice and could be scaled to other filtration systems.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2773/1338

Pyrolysis uses heat in an inert atmosphere to break down biomass and produce biofuels like bio-oil (tar) and synthesis gas. This paper presents a computational study of fast biomass pyrolysis in a laboratory fluidized reactor. A laminar flow regime and an Eulerian-Eulerian approach were considered. A comprehensive kinetic model consisting of sixteen irreversible, first-order reactions was coupled with conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy. The computational model was validated with data reported in the literature. The effect of biomass type and reactor temperature on the thermal decomposition of biomass were analyzed, finding a direct relationship between the content of cellulose and production of tar and similarly between the content of lignin and production of char. Also, the absence of lignin in the biomass dramatically changes the tar and gas compositions.

The goal was to evaluate the effects of particle size in the reaction rate of hemicellulose hydrolysis, and to find the concentration of sulfuric acid in which the reaction mechanism favors hemicellulose hydrolysis of Ipomoea arborescens particles. Once the best conditions were found, Ipomoea arborescens particles were hydrolyzed at different temperatures. A pseudo-homogenous model was adopted to describe hemicellulose hydrolysis.

In Latin America, there are different problems in the management of AW from intensive livestock farming. This study aims to provide a pseudo-radiography of AD management systems with a focus on anaerobic lagoons in Latin America (LATAM). Using data science, quantitative and qualitative data from 1003 scientific papers were synthesized and analyzed to form a database; which allowed evaluation of the congruence of the scientific research with the real problems of LATAM management. The results showed that anaerobic lagoons in the region are the main AW management systems (mainly bovine and swine manure) and that scientific research in this sector does not address the related problems. 38 types of inhibition phenomena with a total of 5264 mentions were addressed in the database.

The results show spills in every well with a high percentage of heavy fractions (mainly polar). However, these are not entirely visible because they are below or between the rhizosphere. Also, higher concentrations of hydrocarbons were found in specific sites such as old incinerators and waste pits. In the waste pits, pollutants had contact with the aquifer. In addition, in the determination of hydrocarbons, the Soxhlet method showed better results than the Petroflag one. Likewise, a relationship between these pollutants and the negative effects on soil properties, such as the increase in densities, electrical conductivity, and sands, as well as the decrease in field capacity and clays were found. Also, pH and salinity increased when the hydrocarbons exceeded the permissible limits (>4400 mg·kg-1).

In the present investigation, the applicability of electrocoagulation for the treatment of domestic wastewater from the washing machine through the use of photovoltaic solar energy was analyzed. The effects of operational parameters such as current density, treatment time on turbidity, , and conductivity were studied. The objective of this project is to research alternatives to domestic wastewater treatment systems from the washing machine, through the use of photovoltaic panels taking advantage of and reusing the water from the washing machine after each washing process. Reduce the waste of the resources from homes, can contribute positively to the environment, and demonstrate that electrocoagulation is a viable alternative in the challenge of protection, conservation, and recovery of water resources.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2809/1334

The changes observed in the dilution are measured and compared as a function of the electrical power of plasma generation (15.0 W, 22.5 W, 30.0 W, and 45.0 W), as well as the exposure time (two hundred minutes per electrical power). Dye degradation for each electrical power of plasma was established by comparing the results from UV / VIS spectrophotometry measurements (absorbance, concentration, and percentage of degradation), pH, COD, and TOC. In addition, the toxicity change dilution was determined by performing bioassays using Lactuca sativa lettuce seeds. The changes for each of the variables measured as a function of the electrical power of plasma generation show the following specific mathematical behaviors: Logarithmic (Temperature, TOC, and pH), potential (COD), and linear (Absorbance). Obtained results showed that the increase in the degradation of the dye and the change in toxicity depends directly on the electrical power and the time of exposure to plasma. The maximum degradation obtained from the samples analyzed at the end of the experiments corresponds to 45.0 W, that is, higher electrical power, a higher percentage of degradation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2793/1337

The reaction system allows the treatment of liquids with plasma generated reactive species in tiny bubbles that increase the contact area between the plasma and the liquid, thus reducing treatment time. The system capability to degrade organic matter was studied using organic dyes in aqueous solution. The discoloration reaction of organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and methyl red (MR), as well as the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the system and determine its potential use to degrade organic pollutants in aqueous phase. It was found that after 5 minutes of treatment the solutions practically lost the color, and a significant part of the organic matter.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2792/1339

Gray essential oil,"This work studies the effect of drying at 40 °C of the leaves and stems of the speciesLuma chequen (Molina) A. Grayon the extraction yield of its essential oil by steam distillation at a pilot scale. From the micromorphological evaluation at the moisture levels fresh state (72±1%), critical moisture (24±1%) and equilibrium moisture (8.2±0.5%), it is found that the tissues fold, the secretory cavities thin out, according to the lacunarity, the microstructure of the plant material exhibits greater uniformity at the critical moisture. For the extraction tests 18 levels of moisture were considered, keeping the packing factor at 54 Kg/m3. The maximum yield of 0.52 ± 0.01%(v/w)was reached when the moisture of the material was 22±1%, very close to the critical moisture. A first-order model provided a suitable fit to the extraction kinetic data for samples with different humidity levels. Based on the evaporation rate equation, a description of the microstructure of the material and the drying conditions, a model was developed which shows the evaporation mechanism to be dominant in both the drying process and in the extraction of essential oil.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2623/1317

Its low cost, structural stability and low toxicity makes it a good option for energy backup systems. However, it is necessary to address the problem with its low ability to operate at high cycling speeds due its low electrical conductivity and low diffusion coefficient. In this work, the LiFePO4 powders were treated with ultrasound for different periods of time to study the effect of reducing the agglomerated particles in the wet mixture during the manufacturing stage. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, particle-size analysis and electrochemical methods. The results revealed that the ultrasonic treatment reduced the size particle of both active material and conductive additive improving the electrochemical behavior and specific capacity of the samples that were treated for longer periods of time.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2493/1327

In construction, Galvanized Steel (GS) is one of the most used elements in urban areas, where atmospheric corrosion is the main problem of its environmental deterioration. The area of greatest population and economic activity in Costa Rica is the San José Valley, which has a tropical monsoon climate with low pollution, defined under ISO 9223 as light urban. The present study of the atmospheric corrosion of the GS, proposes a high correlation for simple linear models, with climatic parameters as main components and SO2as secondary component. Seasonality and sampling sites are partially significant at the beginning of the oxidation process, but this effect is damped over time. The average corrosion rate after 2 years is in the order of 0,4mm y-1, which represents a low level (C2 according to ISO 9223). Complex annual corrosion models, such as those indicated by ISO 9223, overestimate the real corrosion value.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2759/1331

DAFCHO was synthesised by solid-phase mechanosynthesis from 2,7-diaminofluorene and 2-5-bisocycloxyterephthaldehyde and deposited as a film on a glass substrate. The results showed an electrochemical bandgap range of 2.39 to 2.47 eV at 50 mVs−1and from 2.59 to 2.68 eV at 100 mVs−1, which are close to the optical bandgap and electrochemical bandgap of 2.56 eV and 2.35 eV obtained on the film, as calculated by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy and determined electrochemically in a BU4NPF6/ACN electrolyte in the literature. In addition, a greater degradation of the film of the organic compound DAFCHO was observed in the three aqueous media (NaC2H3O2, KNO3and NaNO3), compared with the anhydrous medium (BU4NPF6/ACN) from the literature. On the other hand, the electrical evaluation of DAFCHO exhibits the characteristic behaviour of a P-N-type junction diode.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2619/1336
