In this sense, this short review aims to present a general overview of the trends in bioseparations that will be met in the bioprocessing area of biotechnology in order to continue overcoming these challenges. It is identified that these tendencies will impact the following stages of the bioseparation train: product sources, primary recovery and purification. New approaches involving process integration, intensification and automation, microscaling and greener practices are addressed. Biotechnological processes will continue to evolve becoming the spearhead of process development, targeting products that will benefit lifestyle and improve quality of life. Nonetheless, the aspects that are covered in this work are up to day the state of the art in this constant change and will undeniably have important repercussions in the future of this area.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1293/542

Such modification is driven by: (1) consumers who have become more concerned about the relationship between diet and wellness, and (2) new and novel functional compounds can be prepared when the original structure of a lipid is modified. This trend has led to the design of functional foods or nutraceuticals, namely, fortified, enriched, modified and enhanced foods. Advances in the biochemistry and engineering of enzymatic reactions and reactors have improved the knowledge and understanding of such reaction systems and thus, make available a generation of structured lipids. In the present work, we detail several efforts carried out to prepare novel compounds, as well as industrial applications and possible future enzymatic procedures to obtain new food products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1294/543

Therefore, the design of bioprocesses for their production, extraction and purification is of major relevance. The application of postharvest abiotic stresses (i.e., wounding, modified atmospheres, UV radiation) can be used as an approach to increase the concentration of PC during postharvest of diverse plant tissues. Herein, we propose an abiotic stress based bioprocess for the production of high commercial value antioxidant PC. The strategy proposed was exemplified with experimental data showing how abiotic stresses can be applied to produce resveratrol and quercetin-3-O-glucoside in grapes, and chlorogenic acid in carrots. Finally, different procedures to extract and purify PC produced in the stressed plant tissue are discussed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1295/544

Despite the fact that polyphenols inhibit the microbial growth, adaptation process has allowed developing mechanisms to transform them. One mechanism is the production of tannase, which has been obtained mostly from fungi. In recent years, some tannase producer bacteria have been isolated from different sources, mainly from animals and human intestine and feces as well as from fermented food and fruit wastes. Obtaining high titers of bacterial tannase depends mainly on the culture medium composition, the bacterial strain and the process optimization of culture conditions. This paper presents an overview of the recent investigations regarding the production, the physicochemical and molecular characteristics, the applications and the potential uses of bacterial tannases.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1296/545

Thermostability of PPase-SE was positively affected by enzyme concentration. Enzyme activity of a solution containing 12.5 mg.L−1of Pectinase SE in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, quickly dropped to less than 20 % after 80 s of vortexing. Enzyme pre-incubation (37°C, 30 min) with Ca2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+and Mn2+(0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mM) did not affect the activity except in the case of Cu2+(10 mM). Ca2+(2.5 mM) and Mg2+(2.5 mM) in the reaction mixture caused inhibition and activation, respectively. Ca2+ inhibition was partially reverted by Mg2+. The enzyme is not inhibited by products. Km and Vmax value for PGA was determined to be 0.198 ± 0.013 g.L−1and 0.0509 ± 0.0032 µmol.mL−1.min−1respectively. This Km value is one of the lowest reported for microbial PGases from different origins.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1298/546

To recover the protein activity, the IBs are isolated, solubilized and refolded. The protein refolding processes play a major role in the production of recombinant proteins; thus, various methodologies have been implemented, including dilution, dialysis and column chromatography with or without the assistance of molecular chaperones. Recently, it was demonstrated that the apical domain of GroEL (AD), DsbA and DsbC immobilized on cellulose improved the efficiency of chromatographic refolding of rhodanese and lysozyme. Although immobilized chaperones and foldases greatly improve refolding yields, their use has been limited. To improve their potential use at the bioprocess scale, it is essential to understand the effects of operational conditions and additives on refolding yields. Therefore, we investigated the lysozyme refolding kinetics assisted by the apical domain of GroEL (AD), DsbA and DsbC in either soluble or immobilized on cellulose with different lysozyme concentrations, different chaperone:lysozyme ratios, absence of redox pairing, presence of glycerol and presence of high concentrations of GdnHCl and βmercaptoethanol (β-ME). Our results provide insight to improve the use of molecular chaperones in the refolding of recombinant proteins expressed as inclusion bodies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1299/547

Maximum volumetric enzyme activities of 18,600±1053 and 12,330±1000 U l−1were attained at 3% and 40% DOT, respectively. Whereas maximum specific enzyme activities were 89.4±4.6 y 88.8±4.0 U mg−1protein. We found that conjunction of low DOT and the overexpression of rech42 affected the cell size of the P. pastoris but no the rech42 specific enzyme activity",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1300/548

Fit and parametric sensitivity analyzes were performed to ensure the model could reproduce experimental kinetics at an overall correlation coefficient of 0.9882 and determined its high sensitivity thereof to the determination of the specific cell growth and death rates (µmaxX and kd) butanol production (µmaxBut) and biomass / substrate yield calculation (YX/S g). Finally, in silico batch analyzes were conducted at 60, 100, 150 and 200 g / L of initial glucose concentration values obtaining final butanol titers of 12.97, 13.95, 14.2 and 14.3 g / L respectively, which are consistent with the reported in the literature for in vitro experiments.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1302/549

A 2kexperimental design was used, with two factors (electric field and microorganisms’ growth) and two levels (presence and absence of the factors), resulting in 4 treatments (triplicate) designated as: leaching, bioremediation, electroremediation, and electrobioremediation. Total petroleum hydrocarbons attached to the soil surface showed a higher migration to the aqueous phase due to the application of low intensity current. Growth of native microorganisms present in the soil was stimulated with the addition of micro and macronutrients; TPH were degraded used as carbon source and electron donor, using oxygen (aeration) as electron acceptor. There were statistical significant differences between treatments supporting EBR as the best alternative. Results showed 24.5 ± 3.1% of TPH removal from the soil into the aqueous phase for lixiviation and 32.1 ± 1.4% for bioremediation, both at 360 hours. For electroremediation a 54.8 ± 2.2% removal (360 h) and 68% (700 h) and 68.6 ± 3.8% (360 h) and 89% (700 h) for electrobioremediation. Remediated soil in electrobioremediation reached 2,596 mg TPH/kg soil, such concentration is lower than the maximum permissible limit (MPL) set by Mexican regulation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1303/551

Enzyme immobilization onto solid supports induces changes at structural level in the immobilized systems, and consequently some reaction characteristics can be enhanced; furthermore, immobilized enzymes can be reused in the same process. Due to the unique physicochemical and functional properties that chitin and its derivate chitosan possess, these biopolymers are an excellent option as support for enzyme immobilization. This review discusses the effects on the biochemical and operational performance of proteases immobilized in chitin and chitosan based materials. Some aspects related with the industrial applications of the immobilization systems are also mentioned.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1305/552

Triglycerides are the main compounds in vegetable oils and when its total is beyond 97%, it is possible to produce biodiesel by means of a basic transesterification employing sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. The model takes into account that triglycerides are not soluble in alcohol so two liquid phases exist in the batch reactor, causing the reaction to occur in the triglyceride-methanol interphase. Results show that the model successfully calculates the concentration profile of triglyceride, alcohol and biodiesel in time as well as the intermediaries’ products in the reactor. It also predicts concentration profiles at different temperatures in accordance to the Arrhenius’ Law.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1320/568

All the strains could grow in optimal conditions up to 6 % NaCl and showed sub-lethal growth up to 16 % NaCl; all the strains could grow well at pH values between 4.0 and 8.0; with a sub-lethal growth up to pH values of 2.0 and 9.0. L. plantarum 299v could grow up to 2.0 % of bile salts, and L. acidipiscis up to 1.5 % of bile dried salts. All the strains could be considered safe because all of them were γ-hemolytic and gelatinase negative. Moreover, all the strains showed similar antibiotic resistance pattern and resisted the normal dose used in the food industry of nisin and lysozyme. With these results, it is possible to conclude that the two commercial Lactobacillus strains are halotolerant and that all the strains can be used in a wide range of food products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1321/569

Cooking of unripe banana fruit for longer times (15 and 25 min) decreases the RS content, but increases the SDS fraction. Granular aggregates were produced, which could be formed by partially gelatinized granules. ANN and ANN+S increased the RS content, while the SDS value did not change. The pasting behaviour of ANN and ANN+S showed low viscosity without breakdown or setback due to the restricted amylose leaching, which was higher in flours with ANN+S. The ANN and ANN+S increased the gelatinization temperatures while the annealed and stored samples showed an increase in the crystallinity level due to reorganization of the granular structure compared with native and cooking treated samples. It is possible to combine different treatments to modify the starch digestibility of unripe banana flour, due to that changes in the granular conformation were produced, which decrease its ability to swell and to gelatinize.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1306/553

The sorption isotherms exhibited type II behavior. The BET, GAB and Henderson models were tested to fit the experimental data by using nonlinear regression analysis. The GAB and Henderson models satisfactorily described the sorption isotherms (mean relative error < 4.4%) The isosteric heat (Qs) and the entropy (∆S), estimated as functions of the moisture content, decreased as the nixtamalized maize flour increased",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1309/557

A decrease in anthocyanin content caused by drying at 60, 70 80 and 90 ◦C and 1 m/s airflow was observed. ACyTot and TEAC showed correlation (r = 0.784). The decrease in ACyTot and TEAC in samples dehydrated at 60 ◦C, was associated to the decrease in values of A, P, Fe and FD found in samples dried at this temperature whereas no changes in A, P and Fe were found in samples dried at 70-90 ◦C in relation to those observed at 60 ◦C. The cell contour resulted smoother after high-temperature drying, as indicated by the decrease in FD. The antioxidant activity related to changes in ACyTot and TEAC took place at progressively higher levels in samples that changed morphology in the same proportion among each other.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1310/558

Images obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed modification (p < 0.05) in cell minor axis and aspect ratio. The former was modified by GCA while the second by all the bile salts used. The growth rate (µ) values were: 1.95, 0.66, 0.32, 1.89 and 1.86 h−1 in MRS medium without salts and with GCA, GDCA, TCA and TDCA, respectively. Estimated doubling time was: 0.35, 0.36 and 0.37 h for MRS medium without salts, and with TCA and TDCA, respectively. For GCA and GDCA, a decrease in growth was observed from 4 h and 2 h of incubation, respectively. Bile salt hydrolase activity was determined qualitatively and quantitatively. L. casei Shirota showed activity on taurine-conjugated bile salts.

Tween-20, Lecithin (PhC) and dodecyl sodium sulfate (SDS) were used as the non-ionic, cationic and anionic surfactants, respectively. Particle size was determined by image analysis and agglomeration was characterized with micromorphometric parameters such as fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity (Λ). Average size was maximum (10.65 µm) when using Tween-20, whereas this parameter was the lowest (2.76 µm) when using PhC. The greater contributions to changes in FD and Λ were due to the presence of Tw and SDS. With PhC, it was possible to observe a system with high values of FD (1.92) and low values of Λ (0.15). PhC contributes to the stability of the emulsion despite of the concentration and number of microfluidization cycles and presented better dispersion and more irregular micelle structures than when using other surfactants.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1312/560

The starters growth was followed during the acidification process. The results showed that optimal acidification conditions for L were at the lowest value of sugar and the highest value of the starter concentration. In the case of Y the optimal acidification conditions were with the highest starter concentration but at medium sugar levels. Total acidification times were 4.4 and 4.2 hours, respectively. The growth rate for each starter culture was determined by nonlinear regression resulting lower growth rates for streptococcus (0.705 h−1for L and 0.367 h−1for Y) than for lactobacillus (0.733 h−1for L and 0.389 h−1 for Y) in each starter. Finally, significant differences were found in the time necessary to reach the maximum acidification rate for starter cultures evaluated at the same concentration of sugar.

This type of equipment has received considerable attention in the literature since it can be used for gas-gas separation processes. In specific, in this work we are interested in studying transport of oxygen from an air current to a pure helium flow. The air is transported in the annular region, whereas the helium is flowing in countercurrent within the inner compartment of the system. The membrane is permeable to gases in different proportions; however, only oxygen is assumed to constitute a dilute solution in both regions of the system. To derive the mathematical model, we averaged the pointwise equations in the system cross-section generating a system of two ordinary differential equations representing non-equilibrium mass transfer in each region of the system. These upscaled equations are written in terms of effective-medium coefficients that capture the essential features from the pointwise transport and are predicted from the solution of the associated closure problem. To evaluate the predictive capabilities of the model, we compared the concentration profiles with those from solving the pointwise equations.

The spatial coordinates are discretized using orthogonal collocation with Legendre polynomials while time was discretized via backward finite differences, generating an implicit method that originates a set of algebraic equations, which are solved by nonlinear relaxation for each step of time integration. Nonlinear relaxation is an iterative method that only uses the Jacobian diagonal and voids the RAM storage of the entire Jacobian matrix. This allows the simulation of physical systems that require greater number of nodes that otherwise would use too much RAM when trying to solve by Newton-Raphson. The code was successfully evaluated using several problems related to natural convection previously reported in literature, observing that nonlinear relaxation only requires 0.3%-1.5% of the memory required by Newton-Raphson for the same problems. Furthermore, one can be conclude that, in problems with many nodes, the use of multivariate Newton-Raphson is unfeasible due to high consumption of RAM that can even cause it to overflow.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1317/565

The objective of this research was to characterize the effluent DOM of an aerobic autotrophic nitrifying reactor with fluorescence spectrometry of the excitation-emission matrix in 3D (EEM-3D) and determine if ·EEM-3D could identify soluble microbial products from nitrifying bacteria. The nitrifying reactor was operated at a sludge retention time of 36 days, a hydraulic retention time of 40 hours of hydraulic retention time and fed with an excess of ammonium. Only two fluorescence peaks were identified in the reactor effluent: The peaks were located at similar emission wavelength (416.9 ± 10.3 and 415.5 ± 2.2 nm, respectively), but different excitation wavelength (245.2 ± 1.0 and 330.7 ± 1.7 nm, respectively). The EEM-3D were significantly different than those found in the effluent of aerobic and anaerobic reactors.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1318/566

These structuring techniques have been widely used, however new and more versatile techniques have been developed in order to meet the requirements for new materials. One of these new techniques allows for the formation of honeycomb porous membranes through the use of water condensation. This is a “bottom-up” technique that has some advantages over the traditional methods to structure porous materials. In this review, we present aspects on the origin of the technique, the mechanism of formation of the membranes, the process variables, characterization of the membranes and their current and proposed applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1319/567

The performance of the equipment has been evaluated by producing polyester fibers from different recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) of pharma- and bottle-grade. Flow performance along the extruder length was modeled and the pressure was calculated at standard conditions and considering a flow change of +10% in these standard conditions. The variation of drop pressure inside the extruder was modeled as a function of the Inherent Viscosity (IV) and humidity content (X). In addition, losses of IV were calculated in the temperature range from 290 to 300 °C for different initial PET Viscosity index (IV0). We report the variation of mass flow as a function of pressure applied to the extruder at different temperature for PET recycled of pharma- and bottle-grade. The proposed model for analyzing the mass flow showed a good agreement with the experimental data showing a mean error < 3 %.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1322/570
