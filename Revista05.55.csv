EMPLOYING SOLID STATE FERMENTATION,"This study was conducted to determine the economical and optimal in vitro growth requirements of Penicillium sp. for augmented production of lipases. The optimization of eco-cultural parameters was carried out for solid state fermentation. Preliminary batch testing was performed to find out the favourable conditions for enhanced lipase productivity. The results showed maximal lipase productivity when 10g of the sunflower hulls was utilized as a basal substrate for 3 ml inoculum of Penicillium sp. For obtaining the highest enzyme yields the moisture content of the medium was adjusted at 40% with phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), which was in favour of the fermentation performed at 30ºC for 72 h.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/3/67

The particles were analyzed by atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering and FT-IR, and the percentage of association of lysozyme was determined. The biological activity of the particles was evaluated by viability assays ofAspergillus parasiticusspores and cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cells. The effect on subcellular structures was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The addition of lysozyme reduced the size of the particles. The size and Z potential of the synthesized particles were 725±5.5 and 250±8.1 nm and 28.7±1.0 and 21.6±0.8 mV for CS-Crg and CS-Crg-LZ, respectively. CS-Crg-LZ and CS-Crg particles exhibited a higher (p<0.05) inhibitory effect on the viability ofA. parasiticuswith respect to control, which increased proportionally to the particles concentration. None of the particles showed a mutagenic effect and they did not present cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cells; likewise, no changes were observed in cell morphology with respect to control, observing normal structures in the actin cytoskeleton and in the DNA structure. These results show that chitosan-based particles are a feasible and safe option for the control of pathogenic fungi of agricultural-food interest.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/12/70

Inadequate disposal of effluents, as well as polycarbonate polymers and epoxy resins in the environment and their use in cooking utensils, increases the risk of human exposure to BPA. An alternative method for removal of BPA is the use of oxidative enzymes produced by lignocellulolytic fungi. Thus, the objectives of this work were to evaluate the capacity of Pleurotus sajor-caju crude enzyme broth to degrade BPA and to determine the best reaction conditions (BPA concentration, time reaction, laccase activity, pH and temperature). The experiments to obtain the crude enzyme broth were conducted in bioreactor and BPA quantification was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The crude enzyme broth was able to remove 100% BPA (30 ppm) in 10 hours and pH 5.0. The temperature (20, 30 and 40°C) had no influence on the reaction but greater enzymatic stability was observed at 20°C. The Pleurotus sajor-caju crude enzyme broth, without any enzyme isolation procedure, has shown to be very promising for use in the environmental field in the future.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/146/75

Variations on mechanical, antioxidant and colour properties were evaluated over storage. First, films were formulated using the response surface methodology, modifying three factors: pH, denaturation temperature of WPI, and the amount of glycerol (Gly) as a plasticizer. The combination of 6.2% Gly at pH of 7.9 and temperature of 76°C provided the optimal elongation (%ɛ), as well as, tensile strength (s) and Young’s elastic modulus (E). The TSE was added to the optimized edible films contained polyphenols (187±0.11 mg GAE/g) and antioxidant activity (62.5±0.04% DPPH• and 45.6±0.14% ABTS+• radicals).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/13/78

For continuous application, LEC biosorbent must be regenerated with a suitable desorption agent. The recovery of bound AR27 and the subsequent reuse of LEC were investigated in the present work over seven AR27 biosorption–desorption cycles. Desorption studies showed that the LEC-biosorbed dye could be effectively desorbed (100% efficiency) using dilute NaHCO3solution (0.025 M). Moreover, the biosorbent could be used effectively for at least seven biosorption–desorption cycles without any apparent physical change or damage and with undiminished AR27 biosorption capacity. The AR27 biosorption kinetics was well described by a pseudo-second-order model, whereas a pseudo-first-order model best described the AR27 desorption kinetics. Thus, LEC exhibits remarkable potential for application in detoxification of AR27-contaminated aqueous solutions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/98/86

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of different concentrations of gelatin (0%, 0.75%, 1.25%, and 2.0%) in pound cake formulation reduced in margarine and partially replaced with canola oil. It was determined specific gravity (SG), apparent viscosity, modules of viscoelasticity (G' and G"") and number and size of air bubbles in the batter. In the pound cake was determined texture (TPA and sensory evaluation), crumb structure and moisture. By increasing the concentration of gelatin, it was observed a proportional increase of SG, apparent viscosity and elastic and viscous modules, predominating the viscous module with respect to elastic module, and a decrease in the number and size of air bubbles in the batter. In the pound cake, there was a proportional decrease in the volume and uniformity of the crumb, with respect to the size and number of cavities formed, however, sensorially, the most accepted formulation was the addition of 1.25% of gelatin because it perceives a more consistent and moist crumb, therefore, adding gelatin can be an alternative to improve the acceptability of a reduced pancake in margarine, which it's also less expensive.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/106/61

Latterly, these ingredients were added during the production of gouda-type cheeses and microbiological as well as physicochemical evolution were assessed during ripening. At the end of this process, cheeses were subjected to gastrointestinal simulated conditions to evaluate probiotic survival. Results showed that the survival of microencapsulated cells was above 1010CFU.g-1in the probiotic powder and it is maintained above 108CFU.g-1in the cheese, during all the ripening process (40 days). Furthermore, tests carried out on the final product indicate that the probiotic bacteria resist the gastrointestinal conditions, remaining viable at a high concentration (> 107CFU.g-1). An important aspect is that probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis) and soluble fiber (Nutriose®FB) do not affected the physicochemical parameters of the gouda-type cheese. In conclusion, symbiotic gouda-type cheese obtained guarantees a beneficial effect to consumer, while keeps intrinsic physicochemical properties of the original cheese.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/124/62

The nopalitos were roasted or fried at three temperatures and six time intervals. HPLC and spectroscopic methods to evaluate the modification on the carotenoids, phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity were used. No correlation between antioxidant activity and carotenoids content in nopalitos, either fried or roasted, was found. The highest antioxidant activity was found in roasted nopalitos (125 ºC; 30 min), however at these conditions, the lowest concentration of carotenoid was obtained. The highest content of phenolic compounds was obtained from roasted nopalitos (75 ºC; 20 min). Both thermal treatments, fried and roasted modified the nutraceutical characteristics of nopalitos.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/7/64

A second order rotatable central composite design and the response surface methodology for data analysis were used. The T and FMC showed a greater effect (P< 0.05) on specific volume and moisture of pellets, whereas FMC and DS showed a greater effect on Chroma (C*) and Hue (H*) color parameters. The microstructural properties of the snacks evaluated with the Rapid Visco-Analyzer (RVA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were related mainly to the starch gelatinization. Also, the sensory acceptability of snacks added with DS reached almost 79%. The results indicate that it is possible to elaborate SF with acceptable physical and sensory characteristics by adding DS to a base blend.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/6/63

The effect of YB on physical and morphological properties and on chemical composition of fruit bodies, was studied with three strains. A factorial design was used to study the effect of strain and different proportions of yucca bagasse in the substrate. All strains consistently showed higher yields on wheat straw (WS) substrates and YB:WS 25:75 (average biological efficiency values of 143% and 115%, respectively). Pileus width and length was found to be influenced by both, strains and substrates (p<0.05) but stipe length was significantly influenced only by strain. Both, whiteness (WI) and yellow indexes (YI) were significantly affected only by strain. Using PCA, an important relationship between textural parameters and chemical composition of fruit bodies was established in this study and that strain and substrate are important for both texture and chemical composition of fruit bodies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/11/65

The results showed that the device is able to perfectly discriminate the adulterated samples, separating them into well differentiated groups according to the amount of adulterant. In addition, the analysis of the correlation circle showed that all the sensors in the array provide useful information for the classification of the samples. Additionally, the ability of the device to determine the concentration of adulterant was explored through a PLS regression analysis. The obtained results allow to establish that the electronic tongue device can be used for quantitative determinations. However, the concentrations can present an average variation of 4.54%. This small deviation is compensated with some advantages of the electronic language such as the short analysis time, the elimination of pretreatment of the samples, the ease of handling of the device and its portability.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/35/68

The aim of this study was to characterize and evaluate ten lines of triticale so as to identify and select the best one suited for malt production and brewing. The ten lines of triticale exhibited a protein (11.97–14.52%) and carbohydrate (77.24–82.87%) content good for malt production. The starch viscosity for these lines varied from 33.33 to 104.33 RVU. Four lines (PM–1, PM–3, PM–6 and PM–8) were selected further for malt production. These lines had a high malt extract content of 89.62 to 97.64% and diastatic power similar to some previously known barley malts (86.19–190.19°L). The soluble protein content (4.56%–5.66%) was observed to be more than that of barley malts and the viscosity was high. Two triticale malts, PM–1 and PM–3, were selected for further fermentation with barley malt at varying concentrations (100, 80, 70, 50, 30, and 0%, respectively). Triticale malts (100%) have the potential to generate an optimum fermentation profile (~ 72%). From our study, it can be concluded that triticale malts have the potential to produce high-quality craft beer.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/117/69

The catalysts studied consist of metals supported on γ-Al2O3: Pt/Al2O3and Pd-Rh/Al2O3. In the physicochemical characterization was determined the BET surface area, Thermal analysis TGA-DSC, XRF and metallic dispersion. The catalytic activity of the solids was determined in a laboratory-scale plant for evaluation of catalysts, with a fixed-bed tubular reactor using as model reaction the hydrogenation of toluene at WHSV= 2 h-1, T= 498 K, 8:1 molar ratio of H2-toluene, hydrogen pressure = 724 kPa. The products analysis was carried out in a GC-MS, with methyl ciclohexane as an only product. The standard catalyst (Cat-REF) 0.5% Pt / Al2O3, was evaluated in this reaction and then coked, achieving 97% conversion before and after regeneration. Several methodologies were carried out to regenerate the deactivated industrial catalysts containing sulphur. These catalysts were characterized by the mentioned techniques and catalytically evaluated in the model reaction. The results show that the sulfur content of Pd-Rh/Al2O3catalyst was reduced from 7420 ppm to 370 ppm, thus 95% of sulfur was removed, and however this catalyst exhibits a toluene conversion of less than 1%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/112/71

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The present work aims to study the influence of the ceria content over the catalytic activity of Pt-Pd/Al2O3-CeO2samples during the naphthalene hydrogenation reaction. The cerium oxide content increases, the intensity of the diffraction peaks corresponding to this oxide also increases due to the high crystallinity of the ceria. At low CeO2contents, a shift of the peaks towards lower angles is observed, suggesting an incorporation of Al2O3into the CeO2lattice. Raman analyzes show a single band around 440 cm-1attributed to the formation of ceria.  The aggregation of the ceria in the support also results in a decrease in the BET area of these materials. This enhancement in the catalytic performance was related to a supplementary contribution from naphthalene adsorbed on acidic sites on the support and reacting with hydrogen migrating from platinum and palladium surface by aspillovereffect.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2/72

However, the BW can contain disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). This disinfectant has a high oxidant potential that could reduce the methane production and affect the granular sludge physiology. Therefore, the initial concentration of volatile solids (VS) from BW and the NaOCl effect on the anaerobic digestion (AD) were evaluated in this work. Variables analysed were specific methanogenic activity (SMA), structural morphology and mineral composition of granular sludge. A VS removal of 60% was obtained for 6, 9 and 14.6 g/L of VSo. At low concentrations of NaOCl (< 125 mg/L), a VSo removal of up to 55 % and methane production of 125 mLSTPCH4/L were observed. While at NaOCl high concentrations (>250 mg/L), the rupture of the granules was observed releasing exopolymeric substances (EPS), the SMA decreased to 0.004 gCODCH4/gVS.d.

The synthesis of a composite series of the system (FexMn1-x)2O3was proposed and its structural and optical properties were characterized. The crystal structure and optical properties were evaluated using X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis-IR spectroscopy techniques, respectively. To determine the relative concentration of hematite and bixbyite-type crystal phases as a function of the relative concentration of iron and manganese in the compounds, different refining analyzes were performed by the Rietveld method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed only the presence of trivalent metal species. The main results of analyzing the proposed system were: 1) the optimum manganese concentration and 2) solubility limits of Mn3+ and Fe3+ into the hematite and bixbyite structures, respective. The found values ​​of solar absortance (αs) and thermal emission (εt) indicated that the addition of manganese is crucial for pigments performance used in solar absorption applications.

Although the original composition was designed to synthesize MFI in the presence of a specific organic SDA agent, a MOR phase appeared, very poor in Al. Since the synthetic mixtures used do not have a sufficient amount of Al for the synthesis of MOR in the solution, the Si/Al ratio of the obtained MOR (10) phase differs significantly from the typical one (5). A series of samples were obtained, starting with MFI, through MFI/MOR mixtures, completely MOR phases and finally amorphous mesoporous material. The molar ratio of Na2O/SiO2dictates the type of zeolite structure, which makes it clear that the specific structure of the zeolite (MOR) will be formed regardless of the use of the organic SDA agent intended for the growth of another zeolite (MFI).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/122/89

Test tubes were obtained under ASTM norms with SiO2concentrations around 0.5 to 5% of weight. Compression tests indicated that silica nanoparticles lead to formation of ductile materials with respect to the polymer resin; compression deformation percentages (%e) were determined around 45-52 %; also, while the material resistance reached 90MPa. These materials showed a 38-67% increase in the bending module, and an increase of 16 to 34% in the absorption of impact energy. After mechanical characterization, was carried out a simulation of the mechanical behavior of bumper fascia made with the RP/SiO2-A using finite element software. Frontal and lateral collision indicated a maximum stress around 21.5 MPa and 28.36 MPa respectively, these results suggested that the auto-part will only show plastic deformation in some areas; due to the elastic limit for RP/SiO2is 26 MPa and its maximum resistance at 89.8 MPa","M.

The transport properties were used to simulate a gas membrane sweetening process in order to study their effect on the economy of the process. The membrane with the highest CO2/CH4selectivity achieved the best performance for getting the product into specification, requiring less membrane area, obtaining higher methane recovery and lower gas processing cost (GPC). The effect of pressure feed was obtained by adding a second compressor to the feed stream; the results showed that the GPC exhibited an opposite trend to that of typical studies, increasing it with pressure; an explanation of this behavior is presented. The effect of feed flow on the GPC remained constant and presenting a linear behavior with membrane selectivity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/65/91

Such beans were produced in the Southeastern region of Santander, Colombia. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) tests were carried out. We determined various stages of thermal degradation within the beans, along with their thermal transitions. We also determined the variation of calorific capacity throughout the process. Thermal characterization allowed us to carry out an analysis of the resulting gases, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. We check the resulting experimental data against the Bruker IR database. We were able to detect three sectors within the coffee bean that exhibited mass loss, for a heating rate of 5°C/min, and for temperatures up to 1000°C. Zones were in the following regions: 58.5°C and 324°C, with a mass loss of 50.26%; 324°C and 432°C, with a mass loss of 14.67%; and 432°C and 513°C, with a mass loss of 4.46%. Residual mass was of 24.11%. We obtain similar data with tests at a rate of 10°C/min. We deem this information as relevant for coffee production, especially in those processes related to local production. Similarly, for the start of the characterization of this Castilla variety produced in a well-defined regions of Colombia.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/62/87
