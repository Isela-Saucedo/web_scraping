This study proposes the development and comparison of the anaerobic digestion enhanced with thermal pre-treatment denominated Pre-anaerobic digestion (Pre-AD) and with thermal post-treatment denominated Post-anaerobic digestion (Post-AD) processes for treating wastewater sludge. Additionally, the results from a kinetic model that was developed for thermal inactivation were used to describe the inactivation of faecal coliforms, Salmonella spp. and helminth ova during the thermal treatment stages. In the Post-AD operational batch test, it was determined that a period of 27 d was necessary to reduce the volatile solids (VS) by 38% at an organic loading rate of 0.65 kg VS m−3d−1. When the Pre-AD process was evaluated, 13 d of treatment was sufficient for meeting the stabilisation criteria at an organic loading rate (ORL) of 1.25 kg VS m−3d−1in the batch test. In a semicontinuous operation tests, the Pre-AD process could be operated at an OLR of 3 kg VS m−3d−1, while the Post-AD process could only be operated at an OLR of 1.5 kg VS m−3d−1. The bacteria and helminth ova were inactivated at 70°C for 1 h and 80°C for 2 h, respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1212/489

In this work, the anaerobic digestion (AD) process of such residues was evaluated to define the conditions at which they can be used to produce an alternative energy source. Methane content of the biogas produced was assessed in four stages. The first stage was the co-digestion of R1and R2inoculated with different manures: cow (A), pig (B) and goat (C), in order to select the residue-manure pair to be used. At stage two, the treatment which performed better at the previous stage was selected to evaluate the effect of pH adjustment to 7.2 and/or a C/N ratio to 23/1; during the third stage, it was evaluated the impact of internal temperature (ambient temperature and 37°C) and the addition of two carbon sources (oat straw and sawdust) on the methane content of the biogas produced; and finally, at stage four, the addition of micronutrients (step 4) over methane production was assessed. It was found that anaerobic digestion of rabbit entrails inoculated with 10% of goat manure generated the highest production of biogas with a 71% methane content; which was achieved by adjusting the process parameters (pH 7.2, C/N ratio to 23/1, internal temperature to 37°C and addition of micronutrients). Statistical analyses showed that temperature was the parameter that had the greatest effect on the methane content of the produced biogas; adding micronutrients reduced the lag-phase and helped to achieve 45% of methane in the biogas (minimal value required to be flammable); and, replacing sawdust by oat straw had no significant effect on the production of biogas or methane content.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1215/531

Their stabilities on different pH, temperature and ionic salt conditions were evaluated kinetically, and it was also identified the presence of additional enzymatic activities. Finally, an enzymatic pretreatment of kraft pulp was conducted in order to improve the action of chemical compounds used later on. Enzyme filtrates were resistant to the presence of various ionic salts and denaturing solutions, and they had a good stability into a wide range of pH values (from 3 to 9), although they showed low stabilities at temperatures higher than 50°C. Xylanases and laccases were the predominant enzymatic activities observed on the corresponding filtrates. In addition, the enzyme-pretreated pulp had lower kappa number than the not pretreated control. On the other hand, the enzymatic pretreatment produced liquors that showed high contents of residual lignin and chromophore compounds, which indicate the positive action of enzymes on kraft pulp structure.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1219/491

Certain stress conditions may induce morphological changes in bacteria as a strategy to survive. In the present work, the effects of two antimicrobials commonly found in plants were tested to determine the ultrastructure and morphology of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. Kinetics of survival of bacteria were monitored, and ultrastructure changes were observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively). The results show a bacteriostatic effect on Salmonella at sodium ferulate concentrations between 0.3 and 0.6%, which also caused elongated forms of the bacteria, which were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The Feret diameter and surface area of the bacteria were determined using image analysis, where it was shown that these dimensions increased four times on average compared with those of the control cells. These data support the idea of multicellular aggregates. In the case of Listeria monocytogenes, the elongation of the cells occurred after 24 hours of exposure to 0.6% sodium ferulate. The number of cytoplasmic inclusions and the size of vacuoles increased after the first hour of exposure to 0.8% sodium caffeate and corresponded to a bactericidal effect of this antimicrobial. The elongation of the cells that occurred in bacteriostatic concentrations reverted when the bacteria were incubated in media without the antimicrobials, and the kinetics of growth became normal, which suggests a strategy to survive under stress conditions generated by the presence of antibacterial compounds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1223/493

A mixture of yeast extract-NaNO3, and fructose was used as nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. Under the assayed conditions yeast extract-NaNO3relationship and hexadecane concentrations were the factors which had a significant effect on biosurfactant production at flask level. The optimal conditions, estimated by the canonical analysis of the corresponding response surface were used at a 600 mL bioreactor, obtaining a biosurfactant production measured as 74.23 % of emulsification index, which was similar to the estimated by de quadratic model.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1224/494

C/N RATIO EFFECTS ON MEZCAL COMPOSITION AND SENSORY PROPERTIES,"Mezcal is a traditional distilled spirit beverage obtained by artisan fermentation of agave sugars. In this work we determined the effects of the C/N ratio and the initial concentration of sugars in Agave duranguensis must on the fermentation kinetics, composition and sensory evaluation of the mezcal produced. The fermentation of A. duranguensis must was enhanced by adding 50% more nitrogen (respect to the original content) as ammonium sulfate at an initial sugar concentration of 150 g/L. These initial conditions in the must increased the production of ethanol and volatile compounds such as ethyl acetate, 2-butanol and n-propanol, but decreased the amount of acetic acid, during fermentation. The acceptability of the final product was also increased. The commercial application of these initial conditions in the must composition can improve the production of mezcal, since it may increase the proficiency of raw materials, leaving less residual sugar and improve product acceptability.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1225/495

Additional, the synergistic effect of the bioprotectors was studied through an experimental design of optimized mixture to determine the optimum mixing ratio that maximizes inhibition of Candida intermedia at a concentration of 10 exp 5 CFU/mL. The highest inhibition was obtained using the supernatants of MicroGARD 200®, reducing the microbial load in 3.2 logarithmic cycles, while HOLDBAC YM-C® and Lyofast FPR2® reduced the microbial load in 1.7 and 1.2 logarithmic cycles respectively. It was determined that there is a synergistic effect between the supernatants of the bioprotectors and that the optimum mixing of bioprotectors that maximized inhibition of Candida intermediate contained 23.7 % of HOLDBAC and 76.3 % of MicroGARD, reducing the microbial load in 3.4 logarithmic cycles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1246/511

In this work we develop an aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) process to obtain a chlorophyl-free leaf protein concentrate. A two-level factorial experimental design in order to study five factors that interferes with recovery of total protein in ATPS is performed, employing two model proteins (BSA and Lyz). The factors of polymer concentration and total protein concentration were statistically significative. From here, we applied steepest descent and central composite design (CCD) methods in order to optimize chlorophyl-free, total protein recovery from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) green tissue. An extraction of more than 80% of total protein was reached for bottom phase LPC and 51% of protein in powder from the lyophilized LPC.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1248/512

By fragmenting xyloglucan with a coupled process of acid hydrolysis and thermal treatment, it is possible to obtain considerable amounts of fermentable sugars, glucose and xylose being the most abundant. Xylose is the precursor of xylitol, a sugar with similar characteristics to sucrose. Chemical synthesis of xylitol is very expensive and of low-yield. On the other hand, xylitol can be obtained by fermentation, using yeasts that incorporate xylose in their metabolism, such as Kluyveromyces marxianus. Being a biological process, xylitol production by fermentation depends on different environmental factors. In this paper, the effect of two factors on xylitol production was evaluated based on a 32factorial experimental design: initial substrate concentration (20-80 g/L) and agitation (120-240 rpm). Both factors considerably influenced xylitol production of K. marxianus, where the optimization of the experimental design predicted a yield of 0.57 g of xylitol/g of xylose, with an initial substrate concentration of 50 g/L and an agitation of 177 rpm, from a source substrate of which there are no reports of its use in this field, such as tamarind seed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1249/513

VC extraction was significantly affected (P<0.05) by temperature and time, which was described by a kinetic fractional conversion equation and the Arrhenius model. However, principal component analysis (PCA) performed on major VC determined a differential response of VC to extraction conditions. Two distinctive groups of compounds were identified using kinetic and statistical criteria: compounds associated (GR1) and poorly associated (GR2) with the aromatic profile of peppers. Extraction of GR1 compounds was favored at 40 oC and 80 min; whereas for GR2, extraction was favored at 80 oC and 80 min. The best extraction condition of VC associated with aroma of piquin pepper was determined (40 ºC and 80 min) considering the individual effect of temperature that favored extraction of VC within GR1. The results showed that the use PCA can be a useful tool for a better selection of extraction conditions of the aromatic fraction of interest.><0.05) by temperature and time, which was described by a kinetic fractional conversion equation and the Arrhemius model.

Whey has excellent nutritional qualities and bland flavors; it is easy to digest and has a unique functionality in a beverage system. The ready-to-drink beverage is formulated with concentrated whey, orange juice along with an adequate amount of sugar, stabilizer, citric acid and flavor. Orange juice is used since the acidic flavor of whey is compatible with citrus flavors and particularly orange. The health and nutritional benefits of orange further imparts the value to the formulated beverage. Nine blend formulations are prepared by varying the dry matter of whey, fruit juice and sugar content. Based on a statistical analysis of the sensory evaluation of the drinks, the optimal formulation is found to have a ratio 3:2 for concentrated liquid whey and orange juice followed by an addition of 8% sugar (w/v) and 0.1% stabilizer (w/v). The shelf-life of the final product is carried out both at room temperature (30±2ºC) and refrigeration temperature (7±1ºC) with and without addition of preservatives. The product remains in good condition up to eleven days at room temperature and up to three months under refrigeration condition with addition of 150 ppm of sodium benzoate.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1192/478

White maize was nixtamalizedat 85 and 95°C, with and without ultrasound (843 W·m-2). Pericarp removal, the wáter and calcium absorption kinetics, and the apparent diffusion coefficients (DA) from Fick’s second law, the thermal and structural properties of the nixtamalized flours and the textures of the masa and tortillas were determinied. The ultrasound and temperature affected significantly the wáter and calcium absorption kinetics, showing linear and asymptotic tendencies during cooking and steeping, respectively. These were described adequately by Fick’s model, and the ultrasound significantly increased DAof wáter (2.54-3.93x10-10m2·s-1). Over 80% of the pericarp was removed during cooking. The gelatinization enthalpy showed a decrease at 95°C. Microscopy images showed spherical and polygonal granules at 85 °C, and shape los with increasing diameter by ultradound (95°C).

Aguamiel contained 89.61% moisture, 3.50% protein, 3.10% ash, and 61.31% total reduced sugars, of which 32.63% was total fructose and 28.68% was total glucose, while the fructooligosaccharides content was 15.51%. The aguamiel contained minerals such as potassium, calcium, and sodium in higher proportions, followed by iron, copper, magnesium, selenium and zinc. Were determined water-soluble vitamins B complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3 and B6) and ascorbic acid. It was found a total saponins content of 1.17 g/100 g of sample db, with anti-inflammatory activity. A total of nine essential and eight non-essential amino acids, of the 20 necessary for health, were determined in aguamiel. An additional characteristic was the phenolic compounds content, which exhibited antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS.

This study consists of two parts: Part 1 describes the individual chains present in the starch granules, as the chain-length distribution, and Part 2 characterizes the molecular structure of the starch components by high performance size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detection (HPSECMALLS-RI). The quantification of amylose using two methods (HPSEC-RI and Concanavalin A) is in agreement with the percentage reported. In addition, the ratio Fr III/Fr. II (Fr. II represents amylopectin long B chains and Fr. III represents amylopectin A and B short chains), shows structural differences among banana starches, with more branching in Morado banana starch and less branching in Macho banana starch. A recognition that amylose has significant branching, and thus is not linear, led to the characterization of two populations of amylose: one that is highly branched and the other, which is essentially linear, as established by the HPSEC-MALLS-RI method. Morado amylose has the highest Mwof the branched starches while Macho amylose has the highest Mwand Rzvalues consistent with differences in the structures of banana starches.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1203/482

This defect affects mainly the texture and appearance of the snacks. In the present study, gelatinization enthalpy by DSC was measured in grits, corn meals and nixtamalized corn flours, and correlated with Water Absorption Index (WAI) and Water Soluble Index (WSI), to generate an enthalpy prediction model. Results indicated that the more intense the process of milling was (lower particle diameter), the lower the gelatinization enthalpy values were.

When the treatment consists of more than one stage, the study by means of experiments becomes too vast due to the large number of combinations of treatment variables that can be obtained. A viable alternative of study is to numerically simulate the process and to perform virtual experiments, which, together with the application of design of experiments statistical techniques, allows a deeper understanding of the process at relatively low costs, in order to find more favorable treatment conditions that impact on production costs reduction. In the present study the two carburizing stages, in a four stages process that includes quenching, of a drive shaft, were simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics® commercial software package, giving results which were validated by comparison with hardness measurements performed on treated production parts, later applying a design of experiments based on a Taguchi array.

Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), statistical copolymers from NIPAAm and either acrylamide (AAm) or acrylic acid (AAc), and a copolymer composed of the three different monomers were prepared. These materials were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The polymer diameters in water were in the range from 22 to 42 nm. Copolymers containing acid units exhibit a sharp T/pH-responsive behavior. Polymeric flocculants were evaluated in the turbidity removal from high-turbidity river water and wastewater (urban and agricultural). Temperature and time of flocculation, as well as composition and dosage of polymer were tested. The most effective temperature and time of flocculation were found to be 40 °C and 15-25 min, respectively. Polymer dosage of 0.1 mg mL−1is sufficient for a high percentage of turbidity removal (∼80%). At 1 mg mL−1of flocculant, turbidity removal from 23.9 to 99.2% depending on the polymer composition and water quality were reached.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1252/516

The development of an efficient technology to remove this substance from water is absolutely necessary. In this work a comparative study of different anionic clays and activated carbon as a reference, was proposed to eliminate this pollutant. Hydrotalcites were prepared by the coprecipitation method using ultrasound or microwawe irradiation during the crystallization step. The interlayer compounds were: sulfates, nitrates, chlorides and etoxide-acetylacetonate. The solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption and scanning electron microscopy with EDS microanalysis. The amount of sorbed Cr(VI) was determined by UV-vis spectrometry. The best option for Cr(VI) removal was the hydrotalcite with chloride as anion in the interlayer. It was found that the sorption was mainly dependent of the interlayer anion and the preparation method and it was not a function of the specific area. On the other hand the activated carbon is rapidly saturated and its sorptive capacity is practically null.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1267/519

The anode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. In the experimental tests we employed a tubular and phenol concentrations of 100, 300, 500 and 1000 mg/L using NaCl as supporting electrolyte and conducting the experiments at different pH values of 2, 7 and 12. The mechanism of oxidation was function of the pH, through the generation of oxidants chlorine derivatives added to the generation of hidroxyl radicals obtained from the electrolysis of water. In all cases, removal percentages obtained were greater than 90% measured in terms of decrease of phenol, 80% for the chemical oxygen demand and 70% for the total organic carbon. In the experiments with the higher concentration of phenol in acidic conditions, was observed the effect of polymerization of the byproducts of oxidation of phenol.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1268/520

The biological process was monitored and the membrane filtration profile was assessed by means of a critical flux method with pre-compression step (PCCF), studying internal and external irreversible fouling, also physical and chemical cleaning efficiencies. No inhibitory effects was found except for the highest S/X ratio, observing a digestion limitation due to long chain fatty acids precipitates. External irreversible fouling resistance was up to 52% of the total for the highest grease addition, in every case compressible. Regards to internal irreversible fouling, PCCF allowed detecting effluent and filtration tubing fouling by biological growth, from 1.57 to 0.81×1012m−1, after rinsing the filtration line.

The solids to be dried were silica gel particles. The stable operation zone (SOZ) and the solid’s residence time distribution (RTD) were determined. The SOZ is a function of the solids and air flows and the free area in the conical reduction. The range of values of these variables for which the column operation lies in the SOZ was determined. It was found from the analysis of the RTD of the solids in the column that the solid’s flow pattern in it can be represented adequately by the series of perfectly stirred tanks model and that this pattern tends to piston flow as the number of stages increases. A statistical model for the total pressure drop (∆PTotal) in the multistage dryer was obtained employing the surface response technique and taking as variables the number of stages (N), the ratio of the downcomer length to column diameter (L/D) and the temperature of the air fed to the dryer (T). This model represents adequately the observed variability of the total pressure drop and can be employed as a predictive tool.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1270/522

In the case of the TL spectrometry technique, two lasers in the mismatched mode experimental configuration were used in order to obtain the thermal diffusivity (D) of the biodiesel. On the other hand, the sample thermal effusivity (e) was obtained by using the IPPE technique where the temperature variation of the sample, exposed to modulated radiation, is measured with a pyroelectric sensor. In this technique a He-Ne laser was used as the excitation source and was operated at 632 nm with an output power of 120 mW. From the obtained thermal-diffusivity (D) and thermal effusivity (e) values, the thermal conductivity (k) was calculated from the relationship e = k/√D. The obtained thermal parameters were compared with the values of the thermal parameters of literature. Measurements of particle size and absorption were determined by complementary techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopy, respectively. Our work has applications as high functioning heat transfer fluids in automotive electronic cooling systems and in micro-channel heat sinks (Wen et al., 2006).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1271/523

Ideally, these techniques will be considered from the planning stage. In reality, however, the decision to consider analysis techniques is often made when a project has already a certain degree of advance. This situation imposes limitations to what statistical analysis can accomplish.

Therefore, the aim of this research was to find the conditions for obtaining nanofilaments from natural polymers by the electrospinning process. An electrospinning prototype system built at laboratory was used. The performance of native corn starch water suspension (control), and succinated corn starch mixed with water, glycerol and surfactant were evaluated by electrospinning. Several processing parameters were critical for obtaining nanofilaments, among them were distance between needle and collector, voltage, conductivity, dielectric constant as well as water suspension viscosity. Native starch was not appropriate for obtaining nanofilaments due to particles agglomeration by retrogradation. To overcome those problems, several mixtures of succinated starch, surfactant Tween-20 and glycerol were evaluated. The viscosity was reduced from 664 cP in native starch mixture to 28 cP in succinated corn starch/Tween 20/glycerol, and the resulting low viscosity together with high dielectric constant > 253 were adequated for achieving nanofilament of average diameter of 200 nm by electrospinning due to formation of Taylor’s cone. Corn starch nanofilaments have several amazing characteristics making them optimal for many applications as scaffolds in regenerative medicine, thickeners and glues in other industries.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1276/527

Modified asphalts were prepared by successively mixing the clay and SBS, SIS, or SEBS with the asphalt AC-20. Results show that the MMT modified asphalt may form an intercalated or exfoliated structure. MMT increased slightly both the softening point and the viscosity of the modified asphalts at high temperatures. Furthermore, the modified asphalts exhibited a relatively higher complex modulus and, in consequence, displayed enhanced viscoelastic properties, which improve its resistance to rutting at high temperatures. The high-temperature storage property can be increased by improving the compatibility between polymer and asphalt. The morphology observed by optical microscopy revealed the better compatibility between triblock asphalt/polymer/MMT, thus influencing the final rheological properties of the studied systems. Indeed, asphalt or asphalt/polymer blends gave a typical terminal relaxation behavior for polymer (G’ ∼ ω2, G” ∼ ω1), which is modified by the addition of MMT particles. Furthermore, the activation energy of nanocomposites resulted slightly higher than that of asphalt/polymer blends without MMT.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1277/528

The PET degradation and the characteristics of A/PETdegfilms were analyzed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simultaneous thermal analysis (STA). Terephthalic acid, acid dimers and residual macromolecular chains were the degradation products of PET, which showed different thermal behavior. The thermal stability of the A/PETdegcomposite films was lower than the individual components; this behavior was related to the breakdown of the starch amorphous domains (branching points of the amylopectine molecule) and due to the catalytic effect caused by the terephthalic acid during the thermal process. Additionally, the barrier to water absorption of the A/PETdegfilms was increased depending on the content of PETdeg.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,

The method employs irreversible thermodynamics and reversible distillation trajectories to map, classify and assess process irreversibilities, it employs a multilevel constrained optimization strategy to determine the heat load distribution that minimizes the entropy production in the column. The proposed methodology is an extension of previous works (Mendoza and Riascos, 2010 and 2011), it includes calculation of reversible distillation trajectories as strategy to define limits for design variables that must be estimated in the optimization, and for attainable thermodynamic efficiency. The ethanol dehydration process by extractive distillation using ethylene glycol as entrainer is used to illustrate the methodology, due to the difference between components boiling points and the high no ideality, this system is an interesting challenge for developing of design and optimization strategies. The results show that optimized distillation columns with sequential heat exchangers reduce the entropy generation 14% (solvent recovering column) and 16% (extractive column) compared with its optimized adiabatic ones. Furthermore, the proposed methodology showed to be robust, without convergence problems during the optimization, in that way, it allows to generate a suggestion for the optimal design and operation of the columns.

First, a distributed parameter model of a pyrolysis reactor (from specialized literature) is analyzed and modified in order to be implemented in Matlab. After that, a based sliding mode controller is developed considering the reactor temperature as the controlled variable and the applied heat as the control input.
