The town is a well-known tourist destination where the potable water quality is important for guaranteeing the health of the users. Due to the altitude of the city, the surface and rain water are the main sources of water. Thus, the aims of this study were to characterize i) the composition and chemical speciation of particulate matter suspended in water to determine the content of potentially toxic elements, and ii) the chemical and bacteriological composition of the potable water of Taxco de Alarcón, Guerrero, Mexico, according to the Mexican official norm NOM-127-SSA1-1994.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/927/1342
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Weathering and biodegradation of hydrothermal petroleum in the north rift of Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California","The Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, is an actively spreading ocean basin, part of the system of spreading axes and transform faults extending from the East Pacific Rise to the San Andreas fault.  Upward migration of hydrothermal petroleum in the basin rifts occurs by both bulk transport and high temperature/pressure aqueous and supercritical gaseous (e.g.CO2, CH4) fluid phases into the seabed sediments. The resulting mounds are laden with the youngest hydrothermal petroleum known to date.  The north rift hydrothermal system has been dormant for ~ 3000 years, and organic geochemical analyses of sediment samples collected by both piston and push corers and by dredging operations from various cruises to the Gulf of California show that the organic matter is composed primarily of autochthonous lipids from marine biota, overprinted by hydrothermal petroleum. The chemical composition of this petroleum indicates severe biodegradation for exposed samples, based on the contents of aliphatic, aromatic, steroid, and hopanoid biomarkers. Sulfurized lipids are enriched in the biodegraded oils. Both hydrothermal minerals and petroleum in the mounds of the north rift seabed have been weathered by oxidative/microbial processes.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1054/1343

The analyses assessed that the bone mineral (bioapatite) had suffered modifications in mineral composition, “crystallinity index”, cell parameters and CO2content. However, the paleohistological structure of the bone was not significantly affected, although evidence of microbial attack was found in the bone surfaces. The filling minerals of bone macro and micro porosity were also analyzed; its main filling minerals are calcite (micrite and sparite), clays, and minerals of volcanic origin.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1036/1345

Case study: río Suquía, Córdoba, Argentina","The Suquía river basin (area ~6300 km2) is a medium-sized hydrological system located in the province of Córdoba, in the central region of Argentine. The Suquía river derives from the San Roque lake. This river flows through mountainous areas, crosses a densely populated city (Córdoba: 1.5 million inhabitants) and continues its course through the Chaco-Pampean plain, where agriculture and livestock farming are typical anthropic activities. The Suquía river receives along its course diverse polluting contributions. The degree of contamination of this natural system was evaluated through geochemical and magnetic analyses. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected from the river bed. The environmental magnetism methods (magnetic susceptibility and anhysteretic remanent magnetization) were carried out in order to determine and quantify the magnetic minerals. Major oxides and trace elements were determined in the < 62.5 mm fraction. The sediments show a low degree of mineralogical maturity and are equivalent to shales and Fe-shales. Diverse contamination indices showed the highest values in the mountainous area where the most elevated measurements of magnetic susceptibility were also registered. This is interpreted as consequence of natural factors enhanced by quarries exploitation. The lowest levels of pollution were recorded in the urban area, while in the rural area, a moderate to high degree of pollution associated with agricultural activities was determined. Thus, the processes that originate the geochemical and magnetic characteristics of these sediments are spatially differentiated throughout the basin and are due to the effect of both natural and anthropogenic factors. In addition, metal concentrations have increased in the last decade throughout the basin. A significant correlation between geochemical variables and magnetic parameters was determined, proving the potential of combined studies as a methodology for environmental monitoring in hydrological systems.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1037/1346

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Geometric morphometrics in postcranial bone elements of Late Pleistocene horses in Mexico: taxonomic and ecomorphological implications,"The genusEquusis the last member of the Equidae family whose evolutionary history is about 55 million years. This horse is abundant in Mexican Pleistocene deposits. Elements of the distal extremities (third metacarpals and metatarsals, first and second phalanx of the third digit) of three horse species (Equus cedralensis,E. conversidensandE. mexicanus) from three localities of Mexican Rancholabrean (0.21–0.16 a 0.095 Ma) were analyzed using geometric morphometric techniques. The aim is know whether the shape of each element studied differs between species of horses and also find some ecomorphological connection (formvs. substrate). The results prove the existence of three different groups related with the three species of horse registered in the localities studied; also, the existence of diagnostic elements for the differentiation of the three species of the late Pleistocene horse in Mexico. Based on the three diverse morphotypes is deduced that the species could live in different microhabitats and therefore be able to coexist in the same macrohabitat. Finally, the diversity of morphotypes suggests heterogeneous environments in the study localities.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1044/1348

The Tierras Blancas Member (Turonian- Early Coniacian) is made up of successions of deltaic coastlines (i.e., delta fronts influenced/dominated by rivers or by waves/storms), with ichnofaunistic assemblages corresponding to the Skolithos andCruzianaichnofacies, and a variable Bioturbation Index (BI: 0 – 4), represented by traces of organisms that feed on material in suspension and substrate, with small to moderate traces, controlled by the conditions of salinity, oxygenation, nutrient supply and energy from the sedimentary environment. The Rancho Viejo Member (Late Coniacian-Early Campanian) consists of mixed-type underwater channels, depositional-type submarine channel, channel overflow or abandoned canal, lobe-channel transition, depositional lobe, and mass transport complex (MTC) deposits of type II, characterized by ichnogeneous of the Cruziana icnofacies in its distal variation,ZoophycusandNereites, with a BI variable between absent and abundant (IB 0 – 5), characterized by traces of organisms of moderate to large sizes that feed on suspended material, which combine the activities of feeding and dwelling.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1118/1350
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Identification of jarosite and other major mineral Fe phases in acidic environments affected by mining-metallurgy using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy: With special emphasis on the August 2014 Cananea acid spill,"The sulfuric acid spill into the Sonora river, enriched in iron and copper ions from the Buenavista del Cobre mine (Cananea), gave way to the formation of various solid iron (Fe) phases. In this study, the mineral phases were identified by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and bulk powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and chemically through acid digestions for multielemental quantification, as well as a 3-step selective sequential extraction (SSE) to quantify the types of Fe oxide phases and the contribution of the associated elements. Jarosite was the only Fe mineral identified by XRD, but XAS allowed identification of jarosite with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) incorporated in its structure, making these elements less prone to leaching. In addition, very poorly crystalline phases such as schwertmannite and ferrihydrite were identified in several samples through XAS, which was confirmed by SSE. These phases are probably associated with PTEs. Other possible adsorbent Fe(III) minerals were also identified by XAS, such as maghemite and goethite; as well as mixed Fe(II)-Fe(III) minerals, such as green rust. It was possible to infer the influence of the acid spill on the different sampled areas through various Fe phases identified and/or the presence of gypsum. The influence was detected to be lower where the mineralogy was not associated to low pH and high sulfate concentrations. All precipitated Fe(III) phases downriver from the acid spill are known for their high retention capacities of PTEs either from incorporation into their structures and/or from surface adsorption, thus, contributing to the immobilization of the initial metal(loid) pollution caused by the acid spill. In addition, several other samples of mining-metallurgical wastes were analyzed by the same three techniques, suggesting many of the findings from the secondary Fe mineralogy of the Buenavista del Cobre mine acid spill as common processes occurring in mining-affected environments.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1021/1351
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Evidence for quaternary seismic activity of the La Alberca-Teremendo fault, Morelia region, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt","The La Alberca-Teremendo fault is a 26 km-long, complex fault composed of anen échelonarray of short crustal fault segments, belonging to the Morelia-Acambay fault system. This fault system shows parallel scarps with morphological evidence of recent activity such as drainage alteration, maximum throws of 50 m and minimum throws of 1.4 m that displace the recent soils. The fault acted as a conduit for the formation of the La Alberca de Guadalupe maar (23000 to 21000 years ago) and displaced afterwards its phreatomagmatic sequences. The paleoseismic analysis indicates that the La Alberca-Teremendo fault moved three times in the past 23000 years (age of the maar); this activity caused an average vertical displacement of 87 cm, and might have generated earthquakes with magnitudesMwbetween 6.6 and 7, as well as volcano-tectonic earthquakes with magnitudesMwbetween 4 and 5.5. The displacements were identified on the fault through the superposition of soils differentiated by a disconformity and an anomalous increase in the percentage of clay and organic matter. The La Alberca-Teremendo fault has dominant dip slip with a minor left-lateral component, a slip rate of 0.114 mm/year, and an average recurrence interval of 7726 ± 68 years. According to scaling relations that use the surface rupture length, if we assume that the La Alberca-Teremendo fault moves tectonically, it could generate earthquakes with maximum magnitudes ofMwbetween 6.7 and 7.3, however because of the active volcanic processes in the area, we could expect moderate volcano-tectonic earthquakes (Mw4–5.5) rather than catastrophic ones.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1092/1352
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Fires and volcanic activity: History of fire in the Mexico basin during late Pleistocene based on carbonized material records in the Chalco lake,"Forest fires, considered as free and not programmed fire propagation, are perturbations that greatly alter ecosystems. During fires, variable quantities of charcoal particles are produced by the burning vegetation, which can be later deposited in lacustrine basins. The traditional charcoal size particle model associates the > 100 µm primary particles to local fire events, within the watershed, and the < 100 µm particles are linked to regional fire events, outside the watershed. Fires can be related with favorable climatic conditions, but in tectonically active areas like the basin of Mexico, volcanism can also be a factor producing fires and charcoal particles. We document the history, intensity and frequency of fires recorded in the lacustrine sediments of lake Chalco (core CHAVII-11), by performing a high-resolution charcoal particle analysis in sediments deposited before and after three main volcanic events.  The sources of these events had different distances to lake Chalco: Tláhuac tephra (TTH; 28690 years cal BP), probably produced by the Teuhtli volcano, was a local event; the Tutti Frutti Pumice (PTF; 17000 years cal BP) produced by the Popocatépetl volcano, was an extra-local event and the Upper Toluca Pumice (PTS; 12300 years cal BP) produced by the Nevado de Toluca volcano, was a regional event.  Charcoal accumulation rates (CHAR) and distribution of size particles indicate that paleoclimate was a direct factor defining the intensity and recurrence of fires before and after volcanic activity, as climate defines vegetation type and density, and therefore fuel availability.  Fires before and after the TTH were frequent, local and intense in comparison with fires reconstructed before or after the PTF and PTS events. CHAR values were lower during the more widespread PTF event, than for the local TTH event, although the highest CHAR values were recorded for the most distant, regional, and intense PTS event. These results show that charcoal accumulation rates during the volcanic events in central Mexico cannot be interpreted following traditional model of charcoal particle dispersion. This model have important restrictions in active volcanic regions such as central Mexico.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1090/1354

Application to the karst of the State of Yucatán, Mexico","The Yucatan Peninsula, one of the five regions in which the Republic of Mexico is physiographically divided, is mainly constituted by carbonate rocks of sedimentary origin, which, due to its geological, structural, climatic and hydrogeological conditions, hosts important dissolution processes, which configure surface and underground karst landscapes. Among these, karst depressions in the form of cenotes, sinkholes, uvalas and poljes, have been the subject of many studies, because they constitute important groundwater and historic sociocultural resources, very sensitive to the environmental alteration. Currently, there are about 3000 collected karst depressions in the State of Yucatan (EY), however, the thick vegetation cover usually hinders its location and / or classification, reducing the completeness of the inventory. This paper presents the procedure used to build a catalog in the EY, grouped by types of karstic depressions, using a k-means semi-automatic classification system, using the most relevant morphometric parameters of the depressions, identified by a hierarchical clustering. The inventories used here are: cenotes (from SEDUMA), water bodies (from INEGI), and hypsometric level curves from 1:50 000 topographical maps (INEGI) which have been complemented with the depressions obtained, by two algorithms: DEM (15 m resolution, CEM 3.0, INEGI) filling and hierarchical, implemented in ArcGis, For each inventory, once each has been corrected and rectified, the morphometric parameters have been calculated: area, perimeter, circularity, shape, width, length, and elongation, the first two (logarithmically transformed) and the third and fourth ones, have turned out to be more relevant, after the cluster hierarchical analysis. The k-means clustering method provide, after synthesis of each grouping on inventories, a total of 6587 small depressions, geographically around to the Chicxulub impact structure, 4428 uvalas, 89 large depressions, all of them outside to the Chicxulub edge, and 5176 cockpit karst depression, mos o the spreaded over Sierra de Ticul, Finally, probabilistic distributions of most representative morphometric parameters, have been determined, characterizing each karstic sink tipology resulting clusters.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1017/1355
