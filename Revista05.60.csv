The production of the red pigment prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens is a regulated mechanism that depends on several factors, such as the presence of specific metal ions and carbon sources, for that reason the effect of four minerals and three types of starch as carbon sources on the cultivation behavior of Serratia marcescens BS303 was studied. The role of minerals on prodigiosin content resulted in 1.8-fold increase on the metabolite production using a combination of copper sulfate and ammonium ferric citrate at 0.05 g/L and it is related with the ability of the strain to regulate metal toxicity. The use of hydroxypropylated modified starch as a carbon source caused an increase of 8.1-fold on prodigiosin content and a growth rate of 0.06 h-1showing pigment adsorption and probably scaffold properties for bacterial growth, enhancing prodigiosin production by 8.1-fold. Prodigiosin content raise 570 mg/L with mineral supplementation and polartex instant addition.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/981/355

The Q-C cryogel was synthesized by a self-assembly process induced segregation ice and was characterized before and after adsorption process by SEM-EDX analysis, FTIR-ATR and XPS. The adsorption capacity of the biosorbent was investigated as a function of time and concentration. The data were analyzed using various kinetic and isotherm models. Models of pseudo-second-order and Elovich provided a better representation of the experimental data. Between models of adsorption isotherms, Sips model gave a better fit of the equilibrium data. The maximum adsorption capacity was 185, 186 and 192 mg/g to 30, 40 and 50°C respectively. It is assumed that Cu2+removal is carried out by chemical reaction. Experimental results indicate that Q-C cryogel could be used as a biosorbent material for removing ions Cu2+present in aqueous media.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/995/363

In general, all enzymatic activities were observed in the fermentation broth. Laccases showed the highest activity (18,030 U L−1) in the medium with glucose as unique carbon source. The cellulose activity was 216 U L−1in the medium with three carbon sources (glucose, carboxymethylcellulose and xylan), while xylanase activity was observed around the 200 h of fermentation and the highest value was 240 U L−1in presence of the three carbon sources. Two isoforms of cellulase and xylanase and four laccase isoforms were observed in the zymograms. Most studies on the production of fungal enzymes in solid-state fermentation systems have been made using agroindustrial residues which acting as a support but also as a substrate so the quantification of biomass produced is complicated due to its complex composition, on the other hand is impossible determine whether enzymes of interest are constitutive or inducible. In this study, physiological parameters of Pleurotus ostreatus developed in solid culture could be obtained by using an inert support, also it was determined that in this fungus, laccases are constitutive enzymes, although activity values were changed depending on the carbon sources used, on the other hand, cellulases were inducible and susceptible to catabolite repression, while xylanase enzymes were observed in the three culture media, however, the highest activity value was produced in the culture medium with the three carbon sources.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/998/364

It was evaluated the type of morphogenetic responses induced by plant growth regulators. Furthermore, the content of verbascoside and total phenols was determined, as well as the antioxidant activity in regenerated plantlets. The greatest shoot proliferation (29.2 shoots per explant) was achieved in the stem-nodes that were grown in a half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 4.44 µM N6-benzyladenine. The greatest shoot heights of 4.3 and 4.7 cm (statistically not different) were obtained with gibberellic acid at 4.34 and 8.67 µM, respectively. The highest percentage of rooting (89.4%) occurred with 2.45-µM indole-3-butyric acid with 20.3 roots per shoot and an average root length of 4.4 cm. Of the rooted shoots, 91.7% were able to survive after 30 days of acclimatization. The verbascoside (1.0 mg g−1) and total phenols (24.8 mg of gallic acid equivalents g−1) content was related to antioxidant activity of the regenerated plantlets. The micropropagation ofB. cordata might represent an alternative about massive production and depict the basis of the establishment of commercial crops and genetic studies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1003/365

The biodegradation potential of this pure culture was evaluated at laboratory scale; a wide diesel concentration range, from 10,000 to 50,000 mg diesel/kg soil (ppm), was tested using sterile soil microcosm over a 90-day period. Aerobic biodegradation of diesel by Aspergillus terreus KP862582 was significantly greater (p < 0.05) for 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 ppm, with rate constant values of 0.025, 0.023, and 0.012 1/day, respectively. Cell viability at these concentrations was favored because it showed a significant increase during the first period of biodegradation (0-30 days), from this time onwards efficiency removal and cell viability decreased considerably. This pattern was observed as concentration of diesel increased, resulting in a much lower biodegradation rate for 40,000 ppm (0.005 1/day) and 50,000 ppm (0.002 1/day). Based on the results of this study it is concluded that the strain of Aspergillus terreus KP862582 can be used in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations of 10,000 and 20,000 ppm, and comply with the MPL established by the Mexican regulation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1043/389

A two-step nitrogen reduction cultivation mode was used for promoting lipid accumulation. The inoculum was cultivated at an initial concentration of 90 mg L−1N-NH+4 (nitrogen sufficiency) and at the end of the exponential phase it was fed to 11 L FBR at a sufficient dilution to start with 20 mgL−1of N-NH+4 (nitrogen reduction). The results showed that at similar aeration rates, very different hydrodynamic regimes were attained in each FBR, being more turbulent in the airlift geometry. However, the degree of stirring and mixing did not cause cell damage or photoinhibition. Celular growth of up to 12×106 cells mL−1were observed, nitrogen consumption was always between 16 and 19%, and calculated shear rates were in the range of 120-340 s−1. The major lipid productivity was reached at 1.8 vvm (0.650 and 0.528) mg·L−1d−1in annular bubble column and airlift geometries, respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1045/392

In this work, the inhibitory effect of supernatants obtained from a CEC developed from fecal samples of healthy individuals, was quantified over the growth of intestinal pathogens of public health significance. Baranyi Model was adjusted (R2>0.947) to growth curves of Shigella sonnei-(SF1), E. coli EPEC-(EC6) y Salmonella Enteritidis-(SE3) treated with supernatants, in order to estimate kinetic parameters. Both, growth rate and pathogen concentrations were significantly reduced by the action of supernatants in 89.89% and 86.80%, respectively, for the most sensitive bacteria (SF1) and 23.21% and 36.86%, for the most resistant (SE3). A growth delay of more than 14 hours was presented by SF1 and EC6 with the treatments. Thermal and enzymatic (proteinase K and trypsin) sensitivity of supernatants indicate that antagonism was mediated by bacteriocin-like substances. The CEC developed, have biotechnological potential for the production of antimicrobial substances of interest in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1064/396

The size of the granules were not influenced by the isolation method, but by fruit maturity, going from 2.7-8.6 to 4.5-9 µm at 60 and 90 DAF, respectively. The SN method showed better yields than the ST method, but the purity of the starches was similar in both cases (> 92%). The color of the starches was influenced both by the isolation method and fruit maturity. The rheological properties varied with fruit maturity; the consistency index (K) ranged from 5.49 to 15.19 Pa sn for apples harvested at 60 and 90 DAF, indicating possible structural changes in the granules. All starches exhibited a type-C diffraction pattern and low gelatinization enthalpies between 6.90 and 10.20 J/g. Immature apples can be an alternative source of starch with specific physicochemical and structural properties.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1130/431

A central composite rotatable design was used to investigate the effects of the PSF proportion in formulations (0 - 30 g/100 g), feed moisture content (14 - 20 g/100 g) and extrusion temperatures (120 - 180 °C) on the physical properties like expansion index (EI), bulk density (BD), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), hardness (H), pH and total color difference (∆E). The results indicated that EI, BD and ∆E were significantly affected by increasing the proportion of PSF and BD, whereas increasing ∆E resulted in an opposite effect on EI (P <0.05). Temperature significantly negatively affected (P <0.05) EI and H, while increased moisture content only caused a significant increase (P <0.05) in WAI. Optimal conditions were at an extrusion temperature of 120 °C, feed moisture content of 20 g/100 g and PSF content of 10.36 g/100 g and protein content =11.74 g/100 g.

Nanocapsules with and without urea were characterized by FTIR, TEM and DLS, nanocapsules’ charge was determined by zeta potential. The results of TEM indicated that nanocapsules without urea had a size of 50 nm and with urea 80-100 nm. The hydrodynamic size obtained by DLS was 110 ± 10nm. The FTIR spectra exhibit a peak at 1539 cm−1 in QS-APM nanocapsules, indicating the ionic interaction between the COO- groups and NH+ 2 . New peaks were observed in the nanocapsules containing urea at 1618 and 1458 cm−1 by interaction with the polymers. The physical differences of lettuce crops, control (C1) and experimental (C2), were: foliage weight of C2 was lower compared to C1. The root weight of C2 was 0.5 times. greater than C1. The percentage of nitrogen determined in the leaves was similar in both cases. However the amount of urea used as fertilizer in C2 nanocapsules was only 16% of the control.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1137/435

Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction was performed to explain the interactions of the components between MMT and flour components. The effects of storage time on structure and mechanical properties of the films by X-ray diffraction, tensile at break and elongation were evaluated. Storage of the films produced reorganization of starch components (amylose and amylopectin). Addition of MMT modified the reorganization process, which was observed by X-ray diffraction pattern and mechanical properties of the films. Reorganization process was affected by flour type due to that starch present in those flours has different structural characteristics (e.g., granule size).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1139/437

Drying temperatures of 40, 60 and 80°C and sucrose solutions of 29 and 45°Brix were used in OD. Apparent and true volume, were measured using volumetric displacement and gas stereopycnometer methods. Apparent (ρb ) and true densities (ρp) were calculated with volume data. Porosity (ε) and shrinkage (S) were calculated based on ρb and ρp data. Apparent diffusion coefficient (Daw) of water and solids (Das) were calculated. Micrographs were obtained for both, raw and dehydrated samples. The major water loss (WL) was found at 45°Brix dehydrated at 40 and 60°C, whereas the major solid gain (SG) was obtained at 45°Brix dehydrated at 80°C. A non-linear volume dependence on loss moisture, as well as a ρp and ρb increase and ε reduction with two pseudo-equilibrium periods was found. Micrographs at different depths of the food tissue revealed the effect treatments on two structural anisotropy areas.

Astaxanthin (ASX) is a red-orange carotenoid pigment with, and a powerful biological antioxidant with no pro-vitamin A activity, which occurs naturally in a wide variety of living organisms. In this study, oil in water nanoemulsions of astaxanthin were prepared by high and low energy methods. The influence of oil type and surfactant concentration on the particle size was investigated. The mean diameter of the best treatment was of 40nm. The effect of nano-emulsification of ASX on its bioabsorption was evaluated in a murine model. Low ASX degradation and high antioxidant activity were determined. Absorption kinetics in rats were evaluated, and it was found that nano-emulsified astaxanthin increased carotenoid plasma concentration up to 7.5-fold when compared with a reference solution.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1143/441

When these tissues were observed under optical microscope, differences were found between both ripening stages: the unripe tissue had an exocarp with single epidermis cells in vertical disposition and a mesocarp with a dispersed monolayer of isodiametrical cells; the ripe tissue showed thickened cell walls with sclerenchymal tissue formation. Parenchymal tissue presented homogeneous shape and a bigger cell size. The Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy also showed differences between the two ripening stages: unripe displayed two autofluorescence signals, corresponding to lignin and chlorophylls, while in ripe, a third signal was observed that corresponded to anthocyanins. The analysis of RGB channels analysis showed differences, with the ripe tissue demonstrating more intensity, reflecting pigments accumulation. Regarding the fractal analysis, Fractal dimension (FD) resulted higher for ripe tissues due to the irregular arrangement of cells whereas, FD and lacunarity (Λ) analysis per tissue section demonstrated a morphology change in the section where lipid cell accumulation occurs.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1144/443

The present study evaluates a physical-chemical treatment for enhancing the adsorption capacity of raw orange peel for two model organic pollutants (azo dye and phenol). Instant Controlled Pressure Drop (“DIC” by its abbreviations in french), a vacuum drying technology, was applied as a first treatment, prior to chemical surface modification - either basic, using NaOH or acid, using Citric acid-. The use of DIC modifies and improves the structural properties of the material. Consequently, the combination of this technique followed by a chemical treatment shows an enhancement in the adsorption capacity of orange peels. The results showed that R-OH, R-COOH and R-COOCH3 groups were present on the orange peel surface according to the treatment used. DIC treatment increases the adsorption capacity of raw orange peels 285% for the azo dye and 632% for phenol; DIC treatment plus adding the chemical surface modification, increase the adsorption 640% and 1812% for azo dye and phenol, accordingly.

An interesting biotechnological alternative is to take advantage of the phenolic acids contained in coffee pulp and husk. In both wastes, phenolic acids are esterified mostly in the form of chlorogenic acids, of which caffeic acid can be released by enzymatic hydrolysis. In this work, an extract with chlorogenate esterase activity was produced by solid state fermentation after growing Aspergillus ochraceus on coffee wastes. Highest activity (500 g −1 mU of dry matter) was found after 96 h of culture, using a solid medium formulated with glucose and coffee husks. Chlorogenate esterase activity reached its maximum at 50° C and pH 7, showing a half-life of more than 8 hrs at 40°C. The concentrated enzyme extract released more than 90% of the esterified caffeic acid contained in coffee pulp, in less than 20 min at 40° C and pH 7.

Since the movement of water is essential, drying kinetics allows modeling the process and obtain the effective diffusion coefficient, De f f, key parameter to understand the water transport during the roasting process. Two approaches were compared considering that this coefficient is a function of particle temperature, Tp, and low humidity, MR. For the first model, adjustable model parameters were used, while for the second, a Mamdani fuzzy type of model was proposed. Each model was included in the Fick’s second law to estimate theoretical values of MR. These values were compared with the experimental ones obtained during roasting coffee in a spouted bed at three different levels of air temperature, TA(275, 300 and 325°C). Even though the adjustable parameters model showed a good fit, the Mamdani fuzzy model was much better (R2> 0.999 and SEE < 0.001), but plots showed anomalous values for those regions without experimental data.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1163/458

Multicomponent sorption data of ternary metal solutions were obtained employing Taguchi’s experimental designs and a statistical analysis using the signal-to-noise ratio was performed to identify and quantify the antagonistic sorption effects between these metal ions. This study illustrates the advantages of using these statistical tools for the analysis of multicomponent sorption data. Our results showed that there were significant antagonistic sorption effects caused by the competition between these metal ions in the solution. In particular, Ni2+has the greatest antagonistic effect on the removal of other co-ions, while the ion Zn2+has the less competitive effect on the multicomponent heavy metal removal using bone char. The sorption capacity increased in the following order: Cd2+< Zn2+<< Ni2+. This removal trend may be related to the physicochemical properties of the different pollutants present in the solution. Equilibrium data were fitted to different theoretical and empirical sorption isotherm models for multicomponent systems. In summary, our results suggested that the bone char can be considered as alternative sorbent for treatment of aqueous solutions polluted by Cd2+, Ni2+and Zn2+ions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1164/459

Phase interactions produce several flow patterns where the void fraction is an important variable involved in the behavior and fundamental in flow pattern transitions. Electrical impedance sensors (EIS) determine void fraction and perform as fast response, passive elements, exhibiting resistive, capacitive and inductive behaviors highly dependent upon the excitation frequency. A simple electrical model frequently used is a set of a resistance and a capacitor connected in parallel. Same elements can also be arranged in series, as we do here. We identify three behaviors in the series and parallel arrangements, as well as in the experimental data. While the ones of the series arrangement are coincident with experimental data, the ones of the parallel model are only partially coincident at high frequencies. Moreover, while the parallel model is insensitive to changes in gas volume fraction in the resistive range, the series model presents sensitivity to changes in the gas volume fraction. Therefore, on these grounds the series arrangement exhibits a better performance than the parallel model.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1187/475

The use of biotechnologies as constructed wetlands is an ecologically and economically viable option to mitigate this situation. In this study the removal of contaminants from wastewater was evaluated with microcosms of wetlands planted withTyphaspp. in Pastorías, Actopan, Veracruz, Mexico. Twelve microcosms were implemented; six with tepezyl (ST) and six with porous rock river (PPR) as substrate, from which; three were in ST with plant and as a controls, three without plant. Three microcosms with PPR with plant and three without plant. The study was conducted during the dry (March to June) and the rainy periods (July-September) 2014. No significant effect on contaminant removal was observed with respect to the type of substrate (P > 0.05), nor, depending on the dray and rainy periods (P > 0.05). The average removal of N-NO3, P-PO4and BOD5were 60.3, 55.4 and 80.1%, respectively, in wetlands with Typha spp; while in wetlands without vegetation the removals were 19.6, 18.8 and 63.6 % for N-NO3, P-PO4and BOD5, respectively. The results reveal the use of porous river rocks and tepezyl as suitable substrates for constructed wetlands and the usefulness ofTyphaspp. in removing contaminants from wastewater in dry and rainy periods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1173/467

So it is of global concern glycerol find new uses for generating value-added products. For high purity glycerol it is necessary to remove the water by distillation; so it is important to calculate the energy consumption necessary for purification of glycerol. In this work the optimal conditions for obtaining technical grade glycerol were obtained. In the solution of the problem they were considered constant: the number of tray, and the process pressure; and under the following criteria adiabatic operation of the column, total condenser and known amount of reflux. The results showed that the optimal operating conditions that minimize energy consumption for glycerol 90.5 mol% (98 wt%) purity was 15.23 W using at least four column equilibrium stages. In this work, the number of stages and the feed plate was set to find the minor reflux ratio required to obtain the desired product.

ProII commercial software was utilized to simulate the process with three different configurations: a) single stage, b) double stage with permeate recycle and c) triple stage with retentate recycle, using CH4/CO2/H2S as a ternary mixture with different compositions. The economic analysis was made taking the single stage configuration as a reference in relation to multiple step configurations.

When it is transported or stored, in general, experience some destabilization, forming aggregates that can eventually sediment. Largely this unwanted behavior is due to changes in temperature experienced by the paint. Viscosity decreases with temperature and, consequently, drag forces also decrease; hence, aggregate formation increases due to the higher contact probability between disperse phase units. Whatever the case, a good mix design should avoid its destabilization. Plastic paint industry uses additives (glycols) that have as an object just to keep stable the paint against temperature changes. However, there are environmental, recently established, restrictions that are related to the use of glycols. As a step prior to the proposal of alternative solutions to glycols, a study of the temperature influence on the viscous and viscoelastic flows of a mixture, which consists of basic ingredients of a plastic paint, has been made. The viscoelastic response of the mixture allowed determining that the dominant component in the microstructure is polystyrene.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1242/508

Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic characterized by multiple selective sites that can interact with an acid monomer. The reactivity was analyzed using natural bond orbital charges. The nucleophilic and electrophilic centers become more negative and more positive, respectively, after complex formation. A combination of geometrical parameters, atomic charges analysis and theoretical IR spectra are used to predict the hydrogen bond strength.

From mass and energy conservation equations, a simulator was developed and with a parametric study, the cycle efficiency was evaluated for a generator temperature ranging from 118°C to 190°C and ambient temperature between 25 and 40°C. The obtained results indicate that the generator temperature has an important effect on the ammonia absorption in the GAX zone, its inferior limit is 118ºC and as this value increases, the ammonia absorption in the GAX zone so does. On the other side, the branched mass flow has a positive effect on the cycle efficiency, its maximum value is 1.043 kg/min for generator temperature of 123.3°C and ambient temperature of 25°C, but its magnitude decreases as the generator temperature or ambient temperature increases.
