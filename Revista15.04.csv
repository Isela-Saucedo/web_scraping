Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Geologic fractures arrangement in Miocene rocks from Mexico basin,"The study of fracture arrangement is important for the understanding of fluid flow and has a wide application in several areas as slope stability analysis, geothermal fields, deep aquifers and oil exploration. The facture arrangement is an essential characteristic of the spatial distribution of the fractures, although the relation of the spatial arrangement of fractures with variables such as the rock type, the kilometric faults, and structural inheritance is unknowns. We explore de influence of these variables in the facture arrangement through of detail study of Miocene rocks in the Mexico basin.  The Miocene rocks in the Mexico Basin are affected by three fracture systems oriented NE-SW, NNW-SSE and ~E-W. All fracture families present a cluster array, where the degree of clustering is related to the rock type that constitute the Miocene volcanic succession (lava flows and volcaniclastic deposits). In addition, the intensity of fracturing is stronger in lava flows than the volcaniclastic deposits, with an inverse relationship to the degree of clustering (Lyapunov Exponent). The F1 family (NE-SW) has groups of fractures characterized by a fractal distribution in mesoscopic scale. Meanwhile, the fractures F2 (NNW-SSE) present groups that are associated with mechanical anisotropy in pre-Miocene rocks. This phenomenon is related to structural inheritance and/or reactivation. Finally, the fractures F3 (~E-W) form groups with a random distribution.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1582/1411
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Using electrical resistivity tomography to evaluate the relationship between groundwater potencial and tectonism in northeast Mexico,"The relationship between groundwater potential and tectonic conditions in three sectors of clastic and carbonated sedimentary rocks of northeastern Mexico was identified using electrical resistivity tomography performed in seven transects. The electrical resistivity data were measured using Schlumberger, Wenner and dipole-dipole arrays of the electrodes. Subsequently, the data obtained were combined to carry out a 2D inversion. From interpretation of the electrical resistivity tomography data, several aquifers are located and characterized within varying thicknesses of conglomerates, sandstones and limestones. Additionally, fractures, faults and boundaries between rock types are identified in the obtained 2D models. These structural elements indicate that the aquifers have a strong relationship with the tectonism of the region. Depressed and uplifted blocks are generated through normal faults. The orientations of the inferred fractures and faults fit the structural characteristics of the study region. The aquifers are classified as semi-confined and confined. In clastic materials, these aquifers are classified as granular, while in limestone, they are mainly fractured. Fracture zones that connect most of the aquifers and connect the aquifers with the ground surface are also identified using electrical resistivity tomography. These zones can constitute the main recharge (including contamination) paths to the aquifers. This pollution can be related to livestock and industrial activities, as well as agriculture and mining in the region. Using these results, water wells were drilled to corroborate the identified aquifers.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1597/1409
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,The Cuitzeo granitic xenolith: evidence of an Early Miocene magma plumbing system in central Mexico,"Relevant data on the structure and composition of the crystalline basement in Central México can be found by means of plutonic, metamorphic, and sedimentary xenoliths transported by Neogene and Quaternary volcanic eruptions within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). We present detailed major oxide and trace elements concentrations, isotopic analysis and thermobarometric estimations for a granitic xenolith found in an Early Miocene ignimbrite in Cuitzeo Lake, Michoacán. The xenolith is a calc-alkaline quartz-plagioclase-K-feldspar-biotite-amphibole granite-monzogranite with 73.7 wt.% SiO2. Trace element and isotopic signatures are compatible with a volcanic arc signature. According to amphibole-plagioclase pairs and Ti-in-zircon thermobarometry, the studied xenolith suggests that the granitic system crystallized between 655–737 °C and 1.3–1.9 kbar. U-Pb isotopic analyses of zircon grains from this rock have provided a concordia age of 20.76 ± 0.11 Ma. The presence of granitic xenoliths in Quaternary eruptions produced by the TMVB are not rare. However, this is the first zircon age of a Miocene granitic rock showing evidence of the shallow plutonic counterpart of the magma plumbing system of the Early Miocene (~23 to ~16 Ma) Mil Cumbres - Angangueo voluminous, andesitic-dacitic-rhyolitic episode. Implications for faulting, erosion, and Miocene-Pliocene ignimbrite emplacement in Cuitzeo region are also discussed.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1591/1412
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Application of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques for landslide susceptibility assessment,"Landslides are one of the most naturally occurring phenomena with the highest human and economic losses around the world, reason for the susceptibility and hazard assessment is a fundamental tool for land use planning. There is a wide range of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in the recent literature with completely different approaches to establish the relationship between the independent variable (predictors) and the dependent variable (landslide inventory). In the present study, a wide range of algorithms were used for the La Miel creek basin, in the Colombian Andes, and the methodology implemented for this type of data-based modeling is presented in detail and step by step. The results obtained show that the assembled boosting models present the best values in terms of performance and predictability. Contrasting with the linear parametric models, pointing out their limitations in modeling complex problems such as landslides.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1605/1414
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Tropical glacier reconstructions during the Last Glacial Maximum in Costa Rica,"Numerous high elevation tropical mountains around the world show evidence of past glacial activity during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Cerro Chirripó in Costa Rica exhibits paleoglacial landforms such as glacial cirques, moraine deposits and polished and striated bedrock surfaces. We used aerial imagery (1:25000) and contour lines to develop a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the LGM. We determined paleo-equilibrium line altitudes (paleo-ELAs) using Area-Altitude Balance Ratio (AABR) during the LGM for Cerro Chirripó in Costa Rica. Additionally, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was performed to statistically analyze the paleoglacier volumes and ice thickness combined with ten land surface parameters (LSP). Our results identified thirty-one paleoglaciers covering an area of 28.26 km2during the global LGM, with a maximum ice thickness of 178 meters in Cerro Chirripó, a total volume of 13863 × 105m3and a mean paleo-ELA of 3490 meters. In addition, Area and Slope were the LSP with the highest statistical correlation to explain the paleoglacier volumes, while Area and Diurnal Anisotropic Heating were best for the paleoglacier ice thickness. As one of the first studies in the tropical high mountain environments, this work expands the geographic scope of glacier volume and thickness reconstructions during the maximum expansion of the LGM.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1600/1410

The first unit crops out northwest of the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez in central Chiapas. It is a complex lithological unit mainly composed of siliciclastic rocks interbedded with limestone. Overlying it, the Angostura limestone is recognized. This study focuses on a taxonomic study of the larger benthic and planktic foraminifera from both formations in order to assign age and to infer the paleoenviroment.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1598/1408
