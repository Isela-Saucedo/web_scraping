Growth kinetics and carbohydrate consumption measurements indicated that the six strains were able to metabolise D-glucose and D-galactose as a carbon source; surprisingly, they did not assimilate L-fucose. However, α-L-fucosidase was a cell-associated enzyme and produced constitutively in different carbon sources. The highest cellassociated α-L-fucosidase activity was observed in L. rhamnosus GG (0.16 U mg−1)",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1301/550

SHOOT CULTURES WITH CELL WALL OLIGOSACCHARIDES FROM Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici RACE 3,"Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) are promising natural products for the treatment of chronic diseases because of their wide range of biological activities. Biotic stress as pathogen attack (fungi) may stimulate the synthesis of PhGs through activation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. (Orobanchaceae) in vitro cultures are alternative sources of PhGs, however in that conditions, cultures have a diminished synthesis of these compounds. To increase the yields of PhGs, the identification of factors affecting their biosynthesis is required. Here, we show that elicitation with cell wall oligosaccharides (CWOs) from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici race 3 (Hyphomycetes) stimulates biosynthesis of PhGs by increasing the activity of PAL. Upon elicitation with CWOs (13 µg/mL) the production of PhGs was enhanced by 5-fold compared with untreated control. The maximum PAL activity in shoots cultured under CWOs elicitation were also increased. Elicitation did not affect the shoot growth (length and biomass) but induced chlorosis, and delayed root formation of C. tenuiflora shoots. Our results demonstrate that elicitation with CWOs increases PhGs biosynthesis in C. tenuiflora shoot culture",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1304/554

The production of the red pigment prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens is a regulated mechanism that depends on several factors, such as the presence of specific metal ions and carbon sources, for that reason the effect of four minerals and three types of starch as carbon sources on the cultivation behavior of Serratia marcescens BS303 was studied. The role of minerals on prodigiosin content resulted in 1.8-fold increase on the metabolite production using a combination of copper sulfate and ammonium ferric citrate at 0.05 g/L and it is related with the ability of the strain to regulate metal toxicity. The use of hydroxypropylated modified starch as a carbon source caused an increase of 8.1-fold on prodigiosin content and a growth rate of 0.06 h−1 showing pigment adsorption and probably scaffold properties for bacterial growth, enhancing prodigiosin production by 8.1-fold. Prodigiosin content raise 570 mg/L with mineral supplementation and polartex instant addition.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1368/607

In the present study, the biotransformation of trans-anethole using cells of a Colombian strain of the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum was investigated. Initially, fungitoxicity of this compound against C. acutatum was evaluated; trans-anethole displayed a relatively weak toxicity against the microorganism (<70%, at 200 µg/mL and after 48 hours) and apparently a detoxification mechanism was present. Then, the microorganism was incubated with the substrate at room conditions, using three different culture media (Czapek-Dox, Sabouraud and PDB). Results show that trans-anethole is mainly degraded through an epoxide-diol pathway (trans-anethole to anethole-epoxide, then to syn- and anti-anethole-diol, p−anisaldehyde, p−anisic acid and p−anisic alcohol). However, other minor metabolites [e.g. 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1- propanol, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanol, ethyl ester of anisic acid], possibly proceeding from other metabolic pathways were also found. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the concentration of metabolic products is dependent on culture medium used, being anethole-diol the major product obtained in all media used. Interestingly, some of the compounds generated in the biotransformation have been utilized as flavors and fragrances. Based on the identified metabolites, a possible metabolic pathway of the biotransformation of trans-anethole by C. acutatum was proposed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1373/611

Maximum particle size obtained was 1689.0 nm and minimum particle size was 418.8 nm, which a second order model were adjusted with R 2 values of 0.766 and 0.933 at 25 and 4 °C, respectively. The particle size was affected directly by the homogenization time and inversily proportional to stirring speed and oil:water ratio. Parameters as β-carotene concentration and antioxidant activity showed a gradual decrease during storage, showing a great stability those that were stored at 4 ºC. The optimal conditions to produce β-carotene nanoemulsions with minimum particle size were found at 25 °C for homogenization time 5.99 min, 5287 rpm and an oil: water ratio of 0.8:99.2; at 4 °C homogenization time 5.99 min, 8002 rpm and 0.62:99 oil:water ratio",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1374/612

Little is known about the mechanisms behind this ability. It is suggested that antioxidant enzymes might participate; however, there are no studies reporting the relationship between the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the presence of HMs in an in vitro cell suspension culture of J. curcas. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chromium (Cr) or lead (Pb) at 0.0 to 3.0 mM on the activity of three antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX) through the growth of cell suspension cultures (CSC) of J. curcas. The activity displayed by those enzymes was statistically significant (P ≤0.05) when Cr or Pb was used. The greatest enzymatic activity was noted at the first hour of culture for SOD and at five h for POX and CAT. After 192 h, the activity of these three enzymes decreased, which coincided with the exponential growth phase of the cell culture. The results indicated that there is a close relationship between the presence of Cr and Pb and SOD, CAT, and POX activities in a cell suspension culture of J. curcas, which can explain the plant’s capability for tolerating and accumulating high concentrations of Cr and Pb",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1383/616

Free and total polyphenols were determined by Folin-Ciocalteau method and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC in the manufacturing processes of films. Films from grapefruit and orange peel had 24.95 and 28.18 mg GAE/g (Gallic Acid Equivalents/g), respectively, retaining more than 50% of total phenolics from the raw material. Hesperidin (33.39 mg/g) was the main flavonoid in orange peel based films and naringin (31.42 mg/g) in grapefruit peel films. Recoveries of the identified flavonoids in films were in the range of 31-60%. Residues, mainly those from orange peel process, retained important fraction of phenolics. Edible films with high levels of polyphenols were manufactured from orange and grapefruit peel without the addition of external phenolics extracts.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1259/517

The particle size distribution, morphology, stability during storage at different temperatures and water activity of the microcapsules were determined. The results showed significant differences (P<0.05) among the microcapsules. Higher protection was found in the microcapsules containing aguamiel. The microcapsules had a spherical shape with an average diameter of 7.72 µm. It was observed that the microcapsules containing aguamiel had a minor change in colour independent of the drying temperature and preserved the phenolic compounds for more than 1467 days at a storage temperature of 25 °C. These results suggest the application of microencapsulation with phenolic compounds from xoconostle for food products",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1264/518

In vitro EFFECT ON Pectobacterium carotovorum,"Chitosan is a biomacromolecule with antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, while essential oils are known to possess antimicrobial activity. In this work, lime and thyme essential oils were encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation method. The success of the encapsulation was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Z Potential.

Experimental data of the isotherms were fitted using the GAB and Caurie models and the integral thermodynamic functions (enthalpy and entropy) were estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Kelvin and Halsey equations were adequate for calculation of pore radius which varied from 0.67 to 8.15 nm. The point of maximum stability (minimum integral entropy) was found between 3.61 and 3.81 kg H2O/100 kg d.s. (corresponding to water activity, aW, of 0.19-0.37). Enthalpy-entropy compensation for the microcapsules showed two isokinetic temperatures. The first isokinetic temperature was observed at low moisture contents (< 3.81 kg H2O/100 kg d.s.) and was controlled by changes in the entropy of water, whereas the second isokinetic temperature was considered to be enthalpy-driven (3.81-20 kg H2O/100 kg d.s.).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1275/526

A set of experiments were conducted to compare the effect of the hydrolysis for 10 h at three temperatures (90, 100 and 110 °C) and three juice pH values (2.5, 4.6, 5.5). The hydrolysis process was monitored by measuring the release of sugars and the residual substrate by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).The results obtained with a mathematical model that describes the kinetics of the degradation or hydrolysis of fructan and fructose liberation proposed. The temperature and pH of the sample exert significant effect on the kinetics.

Tin chloride was used as precursor of tin, a 0.2 M solution in 2-methoxyethanol as a solvent and the monoethanolamine as a stabilizer was prepared. From silver nitrate a solution in ethanol was prepared and superficially incorporated onto SnO2 films, thus obtaining SnO2 :Agn, where n = 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 times impregnated with silver solution. A series of samples of approximately 150 nm thickness were prepared and were studied. Several layers of Ag were applied superficially on SnO2 films. The thin films thus obtained are characterized by their structure, XRD, morphology by SEM and chemical composition by EDS, grain shape and size, porosity and surface roughness by AFM, and their electrical and optical (UV-Vis). Properties of SnO2 :Agn samples to propane gas detection in the range of 0-500 ppm gas concentration were tested operating at temperatures of 23, 100, 200 and 300 °C.

The model consists of two particle reservoirs, one at high chemical potential µ1 and the other at low chemical potential µ2 (the terms “high” and “low” refer to the situation in which µ1 > µ2). There are two particle resistors (in this work for simplicity we take h1 = h2 = h), that restrict the particle flows N1 and N2. The net result is a particle flow drop from N1 to an intermediate particle reservoir N3 and from N4 to N2. From the local stability analysis it was concluded that the ECR is stable for every value of h, C1 and Ƭ = nx=ny. After a small perturbation, the system declines to the steady state with two different relaxation times both being proportional to C, h and Ƭ. Finally, when the power output in the steady state versus Ƭ is plotted, it demonstrates how an increment of Ƭ can improve the system stability. This suggests a compromise between the stability and the engine energetic properties driven by Ƭ.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1397/626

The materials obtained were characterized for the determination of their structural, thermal and textural properties. For the evaluation of the catalytic and adsorption capacities of the materials, these were probed both in the reaction of 2-propanol decomposition, as well as in the removal of chrome (VI) from watery solutions; the above mentioned evaluation shows the potential that they have for their employment in processes of environmental remediation. The catalysts obtained on having thermal treated of hydrotalcite like mesoporous materials to 400°C turned out to be active for the decomposition of 2-propanol giving a greater selectivity to propylene that to propanone, with which the formation of preferably acidic compounds is confirmed. In addition the hydrotalcite like mesoporous materials a showed a good capacity for the removal of chromates from watery solutions with values of 44 and 45mg of chrome the (VI)/g of hydrotalcite like mesoporous materials.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1398/627

The KLaH values were correlated with the Reynolds number, observing that KLaH let of be a function of the Reynols for values NRe ≥17,000. The values reached of KLaH were 52 and 44 h-1for naphthalene and 69 and 62 h-1for phenanthrene both with silicon oil and heptamethylnonane respectively. Also was evaluated the volumetric charge effect of the non-miscible solvents, in the volumetric oxygen transfer coeffocient (kLa) for the same stirred tank system with aeration (liquid-liquid-gas system). The addition of each one of the solvents led to strong decrease of the kLa, being more marked the effect with the increase in the volumetric charge of the solvents. The kLa in the aqueous medium without solvent decreased of a maximum of 49 h-1up to minimums of 22 h-1with oil silicon and 7 h-1with heptamethylnonane, in both cases with a volumetric charge of 5% of each solvent. The decrease in the kLa was probably due to a negative effect of the dynamic and kinematic viscosities of both solvents over: the oxygen diffusivity, thickness of the boundary layer and the specific interfacial area of the bubblesair.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1399/628

Nejayote extract was processed by ultrafiltration (UF) membrane on laboratory scale. In experimental tests performed according to the total recycle mode, the effect of transmembrane pressure (TMP) on permeate flux has been studied. The permeate flux no showed a considerable increase for TMP values higher than 1.3 bar, which is considered as limiting TMP (TMPlim) that provides the maximum permeate flux. Filtrated Nejayote extract has been produced in experimental test carried out according to the batch concentration mode working in optimal operating conditions. The extract was analyzed in terms of total soluble solids (TSS), total solids content (TSC), pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, total polyphenols, total carbohydrates, total organic carbon (TOC) and calcium content. The UF process permitted a good level of recovery; it was corroborated with the removal of 95.3 % on turbidity, 22.0 % on TSC, 37.0 % on TSS, 14.7 % on Calcium and 29.3 % on TOC on Nejayote. From retentate was recovered considerable sugar content (rejection of 46.6 % in total carbohydrates).

The objective of this work was to develop a tool application that calculates the size of a rectangular septic tank for domestic or public service with a maximum volume of about 15 000 L. The FOSEP application, built with Visual Basic programming language v. 6.0, calculates the sizing variables length (L), width (A), minor tie bar (H1), major tie bar (H2) and total volume (Vt). The FOSEP tool was applied to a case study to evaluate the design and operation of a septic tank treating the domestic wastewater generated by 60 users of “The Alberto” community in the state of Hidalgo. The design analysis carried out by means of the FOSEP tool showed that the septic tank was oversized, but it removes efficiently COD, TSS, VSS and fecal coliforms",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1413/635

The analysis has been carried out by using a dynamic simulation technique, dividing the equipment in modules and applying conservation laws of mass and energy to each one. The solution of the resulting set of equations for one module was gotten by implementing a simulation model using a software named Simulink. Some parameters included in the set of equations were adjusted by using steady state data from the plant. Coupling the modules, an integral program was created to simulate the ACSC’s performance under different values of ambient air temperature, steam mass flow rate and cooling air mass flow rate. Some disturbances were also simulated toanalyze the dynamic response of the model. Model response was compared versus power plant data as model validation.

ZnO nanocrystals with 5?20 wt % Cu were deposited on the glass substrates at 400°C using the spray pyrolysis technique and then thermal annealed at 500°C for 2 hours in ambient atmosphere. The crystallinity and morphology of the films were characterized by SEM, XRD and Raman scattering methods. The XRD study indicates that ZnO films have a hexagonal wurtzite structure and the Cu addition enhances the preferential orientation along the (1 0 0). The Raman scattering spectrum of Cu doped ZnO nanocrystals thermal annealed at 500°C for 2 hours in ambient atmosphere demonstrates a set of Raman peaks related to the vibrational modes in ZnO for small Cu concentration (5-10%). In ZnO nanocrystals with higher Cu concentrations (15-20%) the CuO phase was detected by the XRD and Raman scattering methods. It was shown that the quality of ZnO NC films can be improved by copper doping with concentration less than 10%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1433/643

The influence of point defects such as mono and di-vacancies as well as the substitutional doping with carbon atoms are also considered. It is shown that the local density approximation within the density functional theory is appropriate to describe these systems. The armchair BNNT with di-vacancies, originally semiconductors, evolve to semimetal in the presence of chitosan; in other cases its semiconductor character is maintained. Zig-zag nanotubes are semimetallic. The high polarity and the broad charge distribution predict its solubility and its possible dispersion in aqueous systems",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1434/644

FT-IR/ATR spectroscopy analyses for adsorbent showed that the presence of reactive amine and hydroxyl groups may be responsible of heavy metal removal. Pseudo-second and pseudofirst order rate equations could explain respectively the Cu (II) and Zn (II) kinetic data in single and binary metal solutions. The adsorbent was used in batch experiments to evaluate the adsorption capacity of Cu (II) and Zn (II) ions in single and binary metal solutions. In single and binary solutions the maximum adsorption capacities for Cu (II) ions, obtained experimentally, were 297 and 1345 mg/g, respectively. While Zn (II) maximum adsorption were 508 and 574 mg/g, respectively. Adsorption isotherms for binary solutions showed that the presence of Zn (II) increased Cu (II) adsorption, that is, the adsorbent was selective towards Cu (II) rather than Zn (II). The adsorption energy shown that the predominant mechanism on Zn (II) adsorption was physisorption and for Cu (II) its approaches to chemisorption. The material has good ability for Cu (II) and Zn (II) removal from single and binary solution",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1435/645

It has been reported that the effect of solvent on polymers could determine the final physical and chemical properties in specific applications. Thus, this article describes a degradation study of poly(lactic-L(+)-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, in the presence of chloroform. The PLGA polymer was synthetized by ring opening polymerization (ROP). Five lactic/glycolic acid volumetric ratios (90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40 and 50/50) were used to prepare PLGA. Copolymers were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and static light scattering (SLS). Copolymer degradation was induced using chloroform as the solvent. FTIR was used to follow variations on the functional groups of copolymers during the PLGA degradation process. The study was conducted using the evidence provided from the modifications of OH wavelength bands (3000-3500 cm-1) obtained from FTIR. A viable reaction scheme to explain the degradation of the copolymer was developed based on the monomolecular constant reaction rates generated by the decomposition dynamic of OH groups.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1439/647
