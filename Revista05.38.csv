However, their evaluation under field conditions has presented inconsistent results, possibly because of the deleterious effect of environmental conditions such as temperature. Considering the potential of a Colombian isolate of Spodoptera frugiperda nucleopolyhedrovirus SfMNPV003 for developing a biopesticide, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature and two drying processes over viral insecticidal activity, in order to use process conditions that allow to design effcient formulation. The nucleopolyhedrovirus, was exposed to temperatures between 3°C and 6°C for 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 minutes. Processes tested were oven drying and spray drying in fluid bed, evaluating pH, moisture content, content of microbial contaminants, viral concentration, yield and insecticidal activity (LC50) of dry virus. The insecticidal activity of the virus decreased when it was exposed to temperatures above 5°C. Oven drying process was selected for presenting the highest yield, also because it did not aect the virus pathogenicity and allowed to obtain a dry powder with a lower microbial contaminants content.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1514/697

Nejayotes obtained from three mills were characterized: reducing sugars 0.166-0.818 g/L, total sugars 23.57-63.41 g/L and protein 5.66-12.92 g/L. The fermentation was performed at 37◦C for 48 h by: Lactobacillus casei IMAU60214, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus helveticus IMAU70129. Consumption of reducing sugars from 60-65%, total sugars from 6-30% and protein from 1-15% were observed. Furthermore, bacteriocin production was evaluated with the supernatants of fermentation. The greatest inhibition by the presence of bacteriocins was obtained with the supernatants of fermentation of Lactobacillus casei IMAU60214, and Lactobacillus helveticus IMAU70129. The highest inhibition was 14% for Listeria innocua ATCC33090 and 10% for Escherichia coli K-12. Bacteriocins presence was confirmed with addition of proteinase K. Since bacteriocins produced inhibited to L. innocua (Gram +) and E. coli (Gram -) can be said that they probably have a wide spectrum of inhibition. In conclusion, nejayote can be used for the production of probiotics and bacteriocins but need further investigation to optimize the production of bacteriocins",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1517/700

The principal difficulties in the use of these enzymes on an industrial scale are the cost of production and limitations on operation conditions (low stability and low catalytic activity). Over the last few decades, a variety of strategies have been evaluated to increase the productivity and improve the biochemical properties of these enzymes. The identification of inducers and the mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated is crucial for efforts to increase laccase production in fungi. Laccase gene transcription is regulated by various carbon and nitrogen sources, the presence of metal ions, the addition of diverse aromatic compounds related to lignin or its derivatives (phenolic and/or non-phenolic), and even the presence of other microorganisms. Although abundant information is available about the biochemical properties and kinetic parameters of laccases, it is difficult to compare different laccases due to the diversity of laccase producing strains, isoforms, laccase substrates, inducers and operating conditions. This review discusses the literature on the induction and production of fungal laccases",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1518/702

EX WILLD) M.C. JOHNST TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ZINC ON THE UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATION OF LEAD,"In vitro studies indicate that Prosopis laevigata can be considered a potential hyperaccumulator of lead. Likewise, lead uptake has been related to protein transporters for zinc. In this work presents a protocol for the establishment of cell suspension culture to determine the effect of zinc on the uptake and accumulation of lead. A bioassay with Pb2+/Zn2+ (0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 mM) was carried out on cell suspension cultures derived from callus induced in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium added with 6.8 µM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) with 4.5 µM kinetin (KIN). Cells showed significant tolerance to growth (GR>60%) at all concentrations and combinations of Pb and Zn (0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 mM). When the Pb with or without Zn were added to the culture medium, the cells showed the highest accumulation efficiency for non-essential (lead) metal over essential (zinc) metal (BF values for Pb»BF values for Zn; 2-33 times). Scanning electron micrographs evidenced the accumulation of Pb in the cells walls. These results provide insights about the tolerance and accumulation mechanisms of Pb occurring in P. laevigata.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1521/703

Mycelial growth rate, biomass production and hyphal diameter of the young and mature zones of colonies of Fusarium oxysporum, Mortierella alpina, Pleurotus pulmonarius, two strains of Pleurotus ostreatus (Po 37 and Po 83) and one strain of Pleurotus florida grown on glucose, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate were studied. F. oxysporum had the highest mycelial growth rate on media containing DEHP (270 mm/d) than on medium added with glucose (90 mm/d). From all the fungi, P. florida produced the highest amount of biomass in medium containing glucose (280 mg/cm2). F. oxysporum and M. alpina produced the highest amount of biomass in media containing DEHP (200 and 82 mg/cm2, respectively). This research suggests that some of these fungi (e.g. F. oxysporum and M. alpina) are able to use these compounds as sole carbon and energy sources, and that the hyphal diameter of some strains was affected by these phthalates. However, further studies need to be carried out on physiology of fungi, on the effect of phthalates in the hypha ultrastructure and on the degradation of phthalates to increase our current understanding of the fungal biodegradation of these compounds",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1522/704

The aim of this work was to achieve heterologous expression by lactose-induction of one peroxidase isoform (PodC) using Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 to produce recombinant turnip peroxidase in a fermenter. Recombinant PodC contained in inclusion bodies was refolded under oxidative conditions and purified by IMAC with a yield of 36 mg L-1 of culture. The enzyme showed a specific activity of 1004 ABTS units mg-1 under optimum conditions (pH 6, 45 ◦C). The value of KM for ABTS was 0.38 mM and the catalytic efficiency (kcat=KM) was 5.4×106 s-1 M-1. The use of lactose as inducer and scale up of the fermentation process may effectively decrease the production cost of recombinant PodC, which in turn can be applied for biotechnological applications",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1524/705

Proteins of xylanolytic system which are secreted during Aspergillus flavipes FP-500 culture with corn cobs as a carbon source, are adsorbed in the solid matrix of cobs unlike wheat bran in which virtually are non-absorbed. Recovery of proteins with washing solutions from both agro-wastes and protein sequences of some of these proteins shows: that increase of pH improves protein desorption, adsorption of xylanolytic system proteins is pretty much selective in wheat bran than in corn cobs and the adsorption of that proteins could be influenced by random interaction between protein and polysaccharide surface as well as specific interactions of proteins with polysaccharides by carbohydrate binding domains of certain involved proteins.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1530/709

There is little scientific information about image analysis application (IAA) to characterize chalkiness development as pattern of the rice grain quality. In this work, chalkiness in the transversal section of polished grain of five rice varieties, using dierent parameters (form factor, fractal dimension concepts, angular second moment, lacunarity, entropy and color) was identified. The multivariate analysis indicated that the studied varieties presented morphometric characteristics that enabled it to be classified with 99.24% of accuracy. The results allowed the grouping by dendrogram analysis in two groups: 1) MorA-92, MorA-98, MorA-06, and 2) MF and MC, distinguishing between varieties, and demonstrating similar morphocolorimetric chalkiness characteristic patterns between the analyzed rice varieties.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1485/681

Commercial cantilevers were cleaned with Piranha solution in order to eliminate contaminants and were functionalized with silylating solution; afterwards the cantilevers were coated by an agarose layer using the capillaries technique. An atomic force microscope in tapping mode was required to evaluate the resonance frequency shift of commercial cantilevers inoculated with L. plantarum 299v. Humidity and temperature were controlled inside an atmospheric hood during the biodetection. The resonance frequency curves were seen to be narrower with higher Q factor values ( ~219). The results showed that the resonance frequency shifted by approximately 5.2 ±0.8 kHz on the inoculated cantilevers throughout the growth kinetics. From the resonance frequency curves and known mechanical properties of the cantilevers, the biosensor sensitivity was determined to be 383 ± 3 pg/Hz and the biosensor can detect ~400 bacteria. In addition, L. plantarum growth on the cantilever’s surface was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that it is possible to construct a microbiosensor by using commercial cantilevers and atomic force microscopy. These sensors canbe used as a platform for the detection of microorganisms associated with functional foods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1490/687

EF were first applied to a commercial enzyme and then to an enzymatic extract from avocado. A fungal commercial PPO was treated at 10 kV/cm for 0-6 min and frequencies from 0 to 950 Hz; after the treatments the enzyme had a minimal residual activity (RA) of 12% after 6 min at 260 Hz. The avocado extract was treated at 18 kV/cm at frequencies from 0 to 760 kHz, and it was shown that the PPO was insensitive to frequencies higher than 1000 Hz, below this level, the enzyme was inactivated to a RA of about 15%. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of this Electric Field system on enzyme inactivation. It is important to mention that in this system there was no physical contact between the food sample and the electrodes and therefore the temperature remained constant throughout the processes",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1496/688

Acetylated starches underwent Maillard reaction with whey protein isolates, yielding glycoproteins with different degree of glycosylation (high, medium and low), which were characterized by the spectrophometric o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) method. Films were made with the glycoproteins, and their physicochemical properties and mechanical were evaluated. Morphologic and X-ray diffraction analysis suggest that acetylation reaction mainly occurred in the amorphous regions of the starch granule. Glycoproteins films did not show significant changes in the mechanical property of the fracture stress, except the film elaborated with the medium acetylation level and the high level of glycosylation, presenting greater fracture stress than the other films. The results of the mechanical tests and water vapor permeability of the films indicated that the glycoproteins could be suitable as coating materials to respiration control and senescence of fruit and vegetables.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1498/689

Water activity (aw) was determined and osmotic pressure in aqueous solutions was calculated. The experimental data of mass loss (ML ), water loss (WL) and solid gain (SG) of apple slices were determined. The apparent diffusion coeffcients of water (Dw) were calculated. The results showed that the awof the mixtures ranged from 0.947 to 0.998; whereas the average diffusion coeffcients of water (Dw) varied from 1.16 to 2.32x10-10m2/s. It was observed that the lesser the quantity of sucrose and the bigger the WPC, mass loss in the equilibrium (ML∞), water loss in the equilibrium (WL∞) and Dw parameters decreased. When used 2:3 and 3:2 proteinsucrose solutions there was a flux resistance to mass, because it is likely to be formed a liquid membrane of biopolymer around the apple",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1501/690

Films with higher MFGM concentration displayed higher ƞintand interfacial viscoelastic properties. When esters of polyglycerol and polyriciniolate fatty acids (PGPR) were added to the oil phase, a competitive adsorption at the interface took place between PGPR and MFGM which caused a decrease in the interfacial viscoelastic properties of the films. The change in the rheological behavior of the films suggests that their interfacial structure was determined by complex interactions between the MFGM and PGPR molecules.Water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsions (ME) with smaller surface-volume droplet size (d3;2), greater stability, and higher storage (G’) and loss (G”) moduli were obtained when higher MFGM concentrations were used in the outer aqueous phase.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1502/691

The heterogeneity considered consists of a discontinuous capillary pressure on the interface. The differential equation was solved using a fully implicit scheme based on the upwind finite volume method. The unknown was the water saturation. This study evaluated the impact of changes in: the porosity of the entire domain, the initial water saturation, the water injection rate, the gravitational force, and the material grain size, on the water saturation at the interface. Experiments have improved the understanding of hydrodynamics on the interface. A full characterization of the porous matrix is an essential condition before defining conditions of oil extraction. The studied algorithm has great potential for use in earlier stages of design and planning for oil extraction",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1531/710

Leachates produced during the first 30 days of garbage composting contained 102.1 g COD L−1, 20 g VFA L−1, acid pH and 0.64 g NH+4-N L−1. Instead, leachates that remained for 3 months the composting plant after being produced contained 15.8 g COD L−1, 2.35 g VFA L−1, a pH near neutrality and 5.36 g NH+4-N L−1 . An anaerobic zeolite packed filter reactor was used for the biological treatment and was operated at a constant HRT of 1.5 d. Leachates were diluted with municipal wastewater (0.4 g COD L−1) to obtain feedings with organic matter concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 13.1 g COD L−1and organic loading rates from 1.2 to 8.7 g COD L−1d−1. Removal efficiencies attained increased from 79.5 to 91.5% and methane productivity from 0.23 to 1.84 L L−1d−1, rendering 0.48 L CH4per g consumed COD, equivalent to 118 kJ L−1of fed influent",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1532/711

Prior to the experiments, a consortium of bacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons was isolated and identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. luteola, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and P. fluorescens. For natural attenuation, mangrove oil contaminated soil was placed in horizontal tubular reactors with air supply and no addition of bacteria. While for bioaugmentation three initial inocula from bacterial consortium (0.02, 0.04 and 0.06 g L-1 biomass dry weight) were added to the mangrove soil, maintaining aeration and moisture (30%). The samples were collected every 30 days during 3 months and the oil content was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC). The degradation of diesel oil range (40.3%) was higher with an inocula size of 0.06 g L-1, where C12, C18 and C26 were the most susceptible to degradation, while in the process of natural attenuation only 4.51% was removed, suggesting that the low nutrient content in the mangrove soil and bacteria number could limit the hydrocarbon degradation. Therefore it is possible to increase the degradation through bioaugmentation in a system as the mangrove soil.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1548/721

Moreover, in contrast to other available dynamic models, this model considers the transient changes in thermo-physical properties of matter by solving the set of equations as a system of ordinary differential equations. The proposed model here was compared with experimental and numerical results of previous studies obtaining a satisfactory agreement. This dynamic model has been incorporated into a computer program developed by the working group whose purpose is to simulate the consequence analysis related to the environmental risk assessment in order to predict the extent of damage caused by industrial accidents associated with emissions, leaks and spills of toxic and pollutant species.

The packing designed by the authors operated in 2012 during March and May. The feed was adjusted to three high hydraulic loads (HL), repeating the intermediate value, and were evaluated each for 18 days in a sequence of disturbances-responses that characterized the steady-state operation of the packing. During March (daily temperatures ranging from 10 to 26.2◦C) were tested 9.2 m3/ m2d and 15.3 m3/ m2d. In May (daily temperatures ranging from 12.2 to 27.9 ◦C), with 15.3 m3/ m2d was observed an increase in the removal percentage with respect to the same value in March, that is attributed to the increase in the average daily temperature. In the last test, with 19.6 m3/ m2d was consequently observed that the maximum COD removal decreased. The organic loads removed from 1.62 to 3.19 kg DQO/ m3 d are related to high load and efficiency packing. The dissolved oxygen measured at three points in the packing are related to the values ofreduction of COD. Nitrogen removal was no-significant in the four experiments.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1554/724

The analysis of the wastewaters from the different process did not match with the parameters established at the NOM-002-ECOL-1996. Those from dyeing had the higher values in electric conductivity because of the sodium chlorine used. We observed that, except for dyeing, the sedimentation as a pretreatment is a viable and economic option to diminish the color and COD until 70% in a simple way, besides the pre-treated water can be recycled or reused in another process which could use not clean water. The phytotoxicity assay showed that the effluents from dye process were highly phytotoxic, those from rinse and softening process were phytotoxic, and those from washing and stone process were no phytotoxic",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1555/725

ADSORPTION OF METHYLENE BLUE,"Banana leaves, which represent the second major residue generated in banana cultivations, were used as raw material for the preparation of six different activated carbons. The adsorbents were developed from this lignocellulosic precursor by means of chemical activation with phosphoric acid, modifying the concentration of the activating agent and the carbonization temperature during the production process. The obtained activated carbons presented slightly acid points of zero charge, high specific surface areas (798.51-1227.60 m2/g) and large total pore volumes (0.83-1.29 cm3/g), resulting mainly mesoporous. These adsorbents were employed for the adsorption of Methylene Blue in batch process. The dynamic experimental data were adjusted to pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic models by non-linear regression, while the equilibrium experimental data were correlated to the Freundlich and Langmuir models. The monolayer adsorption capacities of this dye reached significant values, between 19.08 and 48.01 mg/g",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1557/726

The heat transfer boundary condition at the probe base was estimated by solving the inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP).The model was validated by comparing the thermal profiles measured in AISI 304 and AISI 4140 steel probes with the values calculated with the model. Once the mathematical model was validated, it was applied to predict, using empirical correlations based on the microstructural profile, the hardness profile along the length of AISI 4140, AISI 1045 and AISI 1080 steel probes. A good approximation was observed between the experimental and calculated hardness profiles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1563/731

The method is based on the work of Sundaram and Evans (1993) and considered an overall material balance, as well as a partial material balance. The functional relationship between the concentrations of the bottom and the dome is calculated using the Fenske, Underwood and Gilliland equations (FUG). The solution to the proposed mathematical model has been compared with the rigorous method using Class I and Class II mixtures. The proposed shortcut method is very simple and it can be used for preliminary design, simulation and optimization work.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1564/732

These models use equations known as burning laws to calculate the combustion process evolution and have the characteristic of requiring low computing time. The exactness of the results obtained with these models depend on the user experience with burning law parameters, which result in a limitation of the applications for these models. Several thermodynamic one-zone models based on burned laws are known, however, the solution to the problem using equations relating geometric and operating parameters of the engine to the combustion process, in order to increase the accuracy without requiring the user to have experience with these laws, have not been studied. This paper presents an algorithm programmed in Visual Basic 2008 to calculate performance parameters of reciprocating internal combustion engines such as power, efficiency, spark advance, evolution of the combustion process and pollutant emissions. The simulation results are compared to experimentaldisclosures in the literature.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1568/734

For the duration of the research project, the fuel was stored in bottles made of translucent borosilicated glass at ambient temperature and away from light. Aliquots taken periodically from these samples were tested for density using the UNE-EN ISO 3675 standard, for kinematic viscosity using the UNE-EN ISO 3104 standard, and for their distillation curve using the UNE-EN ISO 3405 standard.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1565/733
