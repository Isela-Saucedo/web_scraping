The work is scheduled for completion in 2009. In this paper we analyze the method of evaluation proposed by the Codex in the document: ""Guidelines for the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants"" and discuss some of its shortcomings. We also mention a proposal put forward by Mexico that, in some cases, the assessment should include post-market surveillance. This is a fundamental contribution to ensure that the guidelines will fulfill their objectives. In this work, we reflect on the method of evaluation defined by the Codex and propose some actions that Mexico should urgently deal with in order to adequately protect its population.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1833/926

Non-contracted and contracted samples of Semimembranosus muscle from 4 animals (6 year old, cows) were used. These samples were cooked at temperatures of 50, 55, 60 and 70°C for 90 min. Tensile tests indicated that at 50°C, contracted meat was tougher than the non-contracted meat. At 55°C a reduction in toughness was only observed in non-contracted meat. Above 60°C, the contracted meat was significantly tougher than the non-contracted meat (p< 0.05). Geometrical (surface and diameter) and structural (sarcomere length) characteristics decreased in both cases. Collagen solubility reduced in the case of contracted meat and this diminution explains partially the toughness differences observed in both samples.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1835/927

The analysis of the extracts was performed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Eighty five components were identified that, subsequently were classified in function of its chemical behavior in acetals, organic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, phenols and terpenes. The alcohols, esters and acids were the groups more abundant in constituent and quantity. Also, we found 30 components previously reported in the literature like important aroma describers in spirits. The analyzed mezcals present a great variability in quantity of constituent and in area percentages of the correspondent picks in the chromatograms.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1843/931

The powder method was used to impregnate the fibers; the impregnation parameters like impregnation height, particle size and impregnation time, were controlled to create the impregnation profiles from were the impregnation conditions for the composite prepared were established. The impregnated fibers were compression molded and tested at tension. The results show that the powder method is a useful alternative to efficiently prepare thermoplastic composites with different fiber contents.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1844/932

This cactus, which produces a red pulp fruit, is mainly grown in the southeast arid zone of Mexico, called the Mixteca Baja Oaxaqueña. Therefore, this work deals with the partial physico-chemical characterization of the red pigment extracted from this fruit. To achieve this goal, the red pigment was obtained by a methanol extraction. The reconstituted pigment was partially purified by using a preparative thin layer chromatography. The pigment bands, were analyzed to get a 200-700 nm absorption spectrum and a gradient HPLC analysis. The latter was performed by using a C18 reverse phase column. The red pigment was identified as betalains, which were composed of 119±3.1 mg yellow betaxanthins/kg fruit and 89±6.5 mg red betacyanins/kg fruit. In the same way, the betaxanthins were made of vulgaxanthin I, vulgaxanthin II and indicaxanthin, but only one betacyanin was found, the betanine.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1836/928

The products (PSU-1 and PSU-2) were characterized to evaluate their possible use as material adhesive. The results obtained using FTIR, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and physical mechanical essays allowed, in a second stage, to modify properties by departing from the modulation of the soft segment of the reaction. This, in turn, could improve the parameters that influence the adhesiveness by taking in account the influence of the molecular shapes in the physical and mechanical properties of high molecular weight compounds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1841/929

The formation temperature and the drilling mud temperature are estimated. For the model we use the temperature in shut-in time taken at a fixed depth, the mud temperature in the surface and the time when the circulation stopped. We also consider the borehole radius, the density and the specific heat of the drilling mud and of the formation, where the measurement of temperature is known.The application of a Marquardt type method as an inverse method and the use of field data showed that the formation temperature and the simulated mud temperature are in agreement to the geothermal gradient and the measured information, respectively. The results indicate that the transitory temperature in shut-in period is a function of the mud circulation, of the shut-in time, of the formation temperature and the radius of the borehole. The sensitivity of the values predicted for the formation temperature are shown. Two examples of calculation are presented.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1879/967

To explain the reasons of the phenomena mentioned, it was used a synthetic hydrocarbon for distillation experiments with heavy oils using vapor-propane. It was found that the lowers boiling points of the alkanes, due to the propane effect, are the responsible of such phenomena.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1880/968

Based on thermodynamic considerations for an efficient use and application of the energy involved in the process, four cases of process alternatives are proposed for which the mass and energy balances are estimated through the use of a commercial simulator; the process schemes are evaluated and energetically compared against the minimum thermodynamic work required for the process. An optimal scheme which may reduce the energy consumption to very low levels (equivalent to only about 4 times the minimum work) has been obtained but demanding a more complex structure and more pieces of process equipment. The final selection of the process scheme must be selected among the different processes herein stated after a further economical analysis that includes both the investment and operating costs involved and that allows getting the best cost-effective option.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1881/969

This task is achieved by combining the heuristic rules of the pinch analysis with a mathematical programming technique, together with an optimal design algorithm of shell and tube heat exchangers based on the rigorous Bell-Delaware method. In this way, the stream pressure drops are treated as optimization variables. As a result, the capital cost of pumps and the electricity cost to run these equipments are considered in this synthesis problem together with the costs for heat exchanger area and utility consumption. Therefore, the major contribution of this method is in addressing properly the stream pressure drops effects on the total annual cost of a heat exchanger network. Furthermore, the method avoids the solution of complex MINLP models and consequently it can be applied to solve large problems. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by solving two published problems, for which the total costs of the solutions resulting from the present method are as much as 72.42% lower than those of the published solutions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1882/970

The asymptotic wake velocity solution for an isolated body is applied to the interaction with a trailing body placed in the leading body laminar wake. By equating the flow defect in the wake to the drag on the trailing body and considering the pressure gradient, an expression for the hydrodynamic force on this body was obtained. The expression is valid in the Reynolds number range 24< Re <130 and has a parameter, which represents the ratio between a characteristic velocity of the flow incident on the trailing body and the uniform flow velocity incident on the leading body. The parameter value was assessed by using experimental data reported in the literature. By considering that the whole wake effect is equivalent to local drag reduction on the trailing body only (i.e. without consideration of the pressure gradient repulsive effect), an underestimation of the hydrodynamic force in approximately 10% was found for small separation distances between the spheres.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1883/971

The development considers expansion effects in the interaction forces between a dilute dispersion of gas bubbles and a continuous liquid phase. The closure relationships, associated with the spatial deviation around averaging variables, were formulated as functions of known variables. In order to solvethe closure problem, as an approach of the heterogeneous structure of the two-phase flow, a geometric model given by an eccentric unit cell was applied. The obtained closure relationships include terms that represent combined effects from translation and pulsation due to displacement and size variation of the bubbles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1884/972

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to obtain the thermal characteristics of corn flours treatments. Oil extraction and reconstitution did not modify the typical endotherm of whole corn masa. Protein reconstitution of DEG flour showed three transition states in which the To, and Tmax of all endothermic peaks increased (p<0.05) as protein content increased. The third endothermic peak of these flours showed very small enthalpies (0.67 and 0.62 J/g, p<0.05) as the Tmax increased (119°C), as compared with the value for the whole flour (73.7°C, and 2.6 J/g); which resulted from protein aggregation. Higher temperature of gelatinization (Tmax) was required when water was partitioned between starch and protein in the reconstituted DEG flour. DSC was sensitive in monitoring declination on protein and oil composition and can be used to establish moisture requirements for appropriate enrichment and processing conditions of corn masa flours.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1885/973
