Himalaya) JUICE UNDER MICROWAVE/ULTRASOUND PROCESSING","The bio-functionality of blackberry juice has acquired great relevance in the field of foodstuff, since it reduces the risk of chronic-degenerative diseases due to its high content of antioxidant compounds such as polyphenols/anthocyanins. However, conventional thermal processing decreases the content of these compounds; hence, alternative technologies —as microwaves and ultrasound— are currently in research. In this context, the effect of thermal and microwave/ultrasound processing on the physicochemical properties, polyphenols (mg GAE L-1) and anthocyanins (mg C3G L-1), antioxidant capacity (FRAP and DPPH), and microbiological stability of blackberry juice were evaluated. The results showed that pH and °Brix increased their value in microwave/ultrasound processed juice (MUJ) compared to conventionally pasteurized juice (FPJ and SPJ) and raw juice (CJ). MUJ showed good microbiological stability after 30 days of storage at 4 °C as well as conventionally processed juices (FPJ and SPJ); nonetheless, in MUJ increased color parameters (L * (a * / b *), ΔE *, H *, C *), content of polyphenols/anthocyanins and bioactivity (antioxidant) were found compared to other juices. Therefore, the microwave/ultrasound combination processing may be used in order to obtain a functional beverage (high in antioxidants), safe for human consumption (good microbiological stability), that preserves its sensory characteristics after one month of storage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/14/85

This study was made to evaluate the antifungal activity of chitosan nanoparticles, pepper tree essential oil (PEO), and chitosan biocomposites loaded with pepper tree essential oil (CS-PEO), on thein vitrogrowth ofColletotrichum gloeosporioides. The particles were obtained by nanoprecipitation and the size and superficial charge (Z potential) were evaluated using dynamic light dispersion analysis (DLS). The mutagenic potential and the acute toxicity were also evaluated. The effect on the radial growth, spore’s germination, viability, and damage to the membrane´s integrity, were determined. The effect on the kinetic growth parameters was also determined. Results showed that the CS and CS-PEO particles diameter was 341.2 ± 12.40 and 355.3 ± 25.3 mm, respectively.In vitroassays showed both nanoparticles with a high inhibition potential onC. gloeosporioides, and low mutagenicity and toxicity. At a concentration of 0.160 mg/mL, the CS-PEO biocomposite presented a greater (P<0.05) inhibitory effect on radial growth, spore germination and viability of the spores, this constitute a natural alternative to the use of fungicidal chemical agents for fungus control.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/15/3

Both systems have been studied for the enzymes production of industrial interest using microorganisms asAspergillussp. that xylanase produced with important industrial application. In this work the effect of culture conditions (SSF and SmF) and the type of inert support (polyurethane foam, perlite and volcanic stone) in the production of xylanase by a strain identified asAspergillus fumigatuswas evaluated. The enzyme activity produced with perlite (54.08 U/gdm) and PUF (17.42 U/gdm) was higher than produced in SmF (2.06 U/mL). Using volcanic stone prevented the production of xylanases. Additionally, the SSF using perlite productivity was 18 times major that obtained in SmF, also, PUF using productivity increased 9 times relative to the liquid culture. Thereby, comparison of the kinetic parameters led to the conclusion that the SSF using perlite as an inert support generates a better alternative for obtaining xylanolytic activity fromA. fumigatus.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/16/4

The use of immobilized white rot fungi cells is considered the best alternative to decolorize these effluents. In this work, a 2kfactorial design was applied to increase the specific decolorization rate (rd) of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) byTrametes versicolor,using free (FC) and immobilized cells (IC). The results indicated that IC were more efficient than FC for RB5 decolorization. Immobilization modified fungal metabolism with a decrease in CO2production, while laccases increased in presence of RB5. Decolorization process at bioreactor showed that IC (removal of 84% in 24 h) were more efficient than FC (85 % in 144 h). The decolorization of RB5 analyzed using UV–vis spectrophotometry suggested that degradation was the main mechanism for dye removal by IC, whereas in FC both absorption and degradation contributed to color removal.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/21/9

Bioreactor performance in catalyzing the flavor ester butyl butyrate was optimized as a function of temperature (°C), substrate molar ratio (butyric acid: n-butanol) and added water (% (v/v)). The bioreactor was also applied to interesterification reactions. The maximum esterification yield (46%) for butyl butyrate synthesis was found at 40 °C, with a butyric acid:n-butanol molar ratio of 1:1.43 and added water of 65% (v/v). The bioreactor proved to be reusable with four consecutive reuses in the esterification reaction, with a residual esterification yield of 64.6% and volumetric activity of 31.6 mmol/mL·h. A high interesterification yield (17.35% in 24 h) was achieved when the substrate concentrations of tripalmitin and triolein were both 15 mmol/L, 35% added water (v/v) and temperature of 40 °C.

To find new yeast strains with outstanding capacities to be used in the production of second generation ethanol; in this study, we evaluated the physiological response to furan derivatives stress by native yeastKluyveromyces marxianus(SLP1), and compared it with the commercial yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeethanol red (ERD). We used a chemically defined medium added with HMF and furfural at different concentrations; a control condition without inhibitors, and four stressing conditions, HMF 7 gL-1, furfural 3gL-1, HMF 3.5 gL-1 with furfural 1.5 gL-1, and HMF 7 gL-1 with furfural 3 gL-1. K. marxianus exhibited a greater capacity to assimilate the inhibitory compounds in less time than S. cerevisiae ERD; also, K. marxianus SLP1 strain showed better behavior to produce ethanol on inhibitory conditions. Despite the effects provoked by the inhibitory compounds, the yeasts could produce ethanol over 80% of conversion. In conclusion, the yeast K. marxianus SLP1 can be an option to produce second generation ethanol at industrial level.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/30/16

UNDER NITROGEN DEFICIENCY AND STARVATION STRESS IN A TEMPORARY IMMERSION SYSTEM,"Castilleja tenuifloraBenth. is a medicinal plant that synthesizes polyphenolic compounds such as phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), flavonoids, lignans, and iridoid glycosides with pharmacological activities.In vitroculturing of plants combined with a stress as nutrient deficiency has been shown to be a good biotechnological strategy to stimulate secondary metabolism. Our aim was to evaluate the responses ofC. tenuifloraplants to stress by nitrogen (N) deficiency and starvation in a temporary immersion system. The treatments were plants grown in B5 liquid medium with 25.74 mM (control), 1.32, 0.66 (deficiency) and 0 mM (starvation) N concentration. Matter and shoot multiplication rate decreased over 40%, chlorophylls content decreased, roots length increased, and leaves showed chlorosis. In deficiency conditions (0.66 mM N), PAL enzyme was more active and total phenolic compounds were enhanced. At day 21: maximum concentration of verbascoside, isoverbascoside and aucubin was observed in 0.66, 1.32 and 0 mM N treatments (283 ± 0.5, 90 ± 0.3 and 12.5 ± 0.1 mg g-1DM, respectively) and presence of anthocyanins was evident in stems. Under N deficiency, the first defense response is an oxidative burst, PhGs and iridoids are powerful antioxidants; thereby, the increase of these compounds andde novosynthesis of anthocyanins relief oxidative damage. Our results show thatin vitroculture in a temporary immersion system combined with N deficiency is an excellent method to increase secondary metabolites inC. tenuifloraplants.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/34/19

The bioaccessibility of starch depends on the food microstructures. Therefore, the understanding of the physicochemical transformations of the starch suffered during LAF will allow to develop an adequate processing of the alimentary matrices. In this work, native corn starch (NCS) dispersions were inoculated withLactobacillus bulgaricus(2x107cells ml-1) and fermented for 24 h at 38 ºC. Physicochemical changes of starch granules during fermentation time were monitored by XRD, FTIR and DSC. The crystallinity content achieved a maximum value (39.72±1.02%) after 12 h of fermentation. In contrast, the absorbance ratio 1047/1022 from FTIR measurements increased as the fermentation advanced. Likewise, DSC analysis showed that the gelatinization enthalpy increased 60.0% after 12 h of fermentation, reflecting the production of ordered microstructures. Thus, it is suggested that LAF increased the resistant starch content in corn starch granules.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/39/23

It bio-synthesize metabolite such as verbascoside that contribute to its ethno-therapeutic properties as anti-inflammatory remedy. HPLC analysis showed that the methanolic extract from cell suspension cultures (Bc-Cc) and wild plant leaves (Bc-Wp) contained verbascoside, but concentration was higher in Bc-Cc (87.48 mg/g) than in wild plant (47.34 mg/g). In the acute toxicity model, none of the extracts generated any lethality or adverse effects. In acute inflammation model induced with TPA, Bc-Cc extract showed a greater edema inhibition at 2 mg/ear (61.72%), as well for carrageenan model at 200 mg/kg (48.87%). Bc-Wp showed lesser anti-inflammatory effect in both acute inflammation models than Bc-Cc. For Adjuvant-induced arthritis both extracts at 250 mg/kg generated a moderate inhibition over edema (≈33%) at day 28, and they were statistically no different to phenilbutazone. The culture in suspension ofB. cordataobtained by biotechnological process contains greater amount of verbascosido and showed better anti-inflammatory activity; thus, representing a source for obtaining this type of secondary metabolite of pharmacological interest.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/42/26

Atlixco,"Acid hydrolysis from cladodes ofOpuntia sp. var Atlixco was performed. The total reducing sugars released showed a linear relation to the concentration of phenolic compounds released, which can be a determining factor in fermentative processes. Wild microorganisms were isolated from the cladodes, three of which showed fermentative capacity using nopal hydrolysates. Molecular identification showed the presence ofCandida intermedia, Saccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii; microorganisms that proved capable of producing ethanol. The results showed that pH is the principle factor that impacted ethanol production, and that when associated with conditions of oxygen limitation generated yields (Yp/s) of 48 % compared to the maximum theoretical value. Also, adding magnesium salt to the culture medium at a concentration of 0.5 g/L had the greatest effect on ethanol production forS. cerevisiaeandZ. bailii. In other results, a slight reduction in product formation was observed forZ. bailiiwhen (NH4)2SO4was used as the nitrogen source, while forS. cerevisiae, ethanol production increased slightly, from 1.64 to 2.11 g/L when the hydrolized is used with 5 g/L of nitrogen salts. These results show that, in general, adding the nitrogen source did not promote product formation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/44/28

In this research, films consisting of chitosan, oleic acid/beeswax and lemon essential oil were made. The fracture stress, percent elongation, and water vapor permeability of the preformed films were determined. The coatings were applied by immersion in two maturity stages (green-ripe and red-ripe) of Cuauhtemoc tomatoes; they were stored at two temperatures (25 ± 2 and 10 ± 2 °C) and the parameters of firmness, TSS, color, weight loss, CO2and ethylene were evaluated. The chitosan-oleic acid-lemon film showed higher fracture stress than the chitosan-beeswax-lemon film (18.68 and 12.50 mPa, respectively) and lower water vapor permeability (5.08x1010g m1s1Pa1). Weight loss was lower in fruits treated with chitosan-oleic acid-lemon (7.9%).

In this study, films were elaborated with pomegranate juice and chitosan. Films were exposed to selected dosages UVC and its effect on color, mechanical properties, permeability and water solubility of edible films were determined. Additionally, studied films were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy in order to determine possible structural changes. UVC radiation increased the tensile strength and rigidity of the studied films, but their elongation decreased. The permeability of films decreased with UVC dosage, while their water solubility was not affected. The net color change of studied films increased as UVC dosage was increased. According to FTIR analysis, UVC radiation produced structural changes in edible films, which were more important at the highest tested dosage (1555.2 J/m2).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/17/5

All MEs containing NaCl showed stability during storage time (28 days). The size (d3,2) of the ME was affected by the concentration of MFGM in the external aqueous phase as well as the pH. Emulsions formulated with higher concentrations of MFGM (5%, 6%, and 6.4%) had greater stability. The release of NaCl was observed to decrease at concentrations of 6% MFGM, and pH 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. ME formulated at different concentrations of MFGM and different pH levels, exhibited increases in modulus G’ and G’’ as a function of the deformation, showing values of G’ higher than those of G’’ with up to 10% deformation.

HPP treatments of commercial UHT milk yielded two decimal reductions (SVHPP= 2 log10reductions) ofL. innocuawith 550 MPa/3min, while the HPP+nisin approach yielded <10 cfu ml-1under the same pressure-time conditions. NativeListeria monocytogeneswas found in raw milk (~102cfu ml-1) and the totalListeriaspp. counts increased to ~109cfu ml-1with theL. innocuainoculum. HPP milk pasteurization (SVHPP≥ 5 log10, aerobic plate count; <1 cfu ml-1,Listeriaspp.) was viable by using 600 MPa/12 min, whereas at this pressure level the HPP+nisin approach resulted in milk pasteurization at holding times between 6 and 9 min. Furthermore, LUQ2 synthesized 9.75±0.54 IU ml-1of nisin, which is below the FAO/WHO limit (500 IU g-1) suggesting that the promising HPP+nisin approach could be further optimized.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/38/22

BY VIBRO-FLUIDIZED BED DRYING.,"The waste of food in México was over 16.5 tons’ millions in 2009. In the case of the onion, it was 250,352.61 tons. This research proposes a methodology to avail the wasted onion through vibrofluidized bed drying (VBD). The air-drying temperature, the charge of the material into the dryer and the geometry of the cut was analyzed with respect to the effective diffusion coefficient (Def) [m2s-1], the value of residual pungency (mmol piruvate g-1) and production cost ($/kg-1). The percentage of retention for initial pungency was 42-52, 50-56 and 56-72 in dried onion at 60, 70 and 80 °C respectively. The greater values were for onions segments geometry. There was not difference onDeffor the bulk of material for any geometry, however theDefvalue in onions segments was greater than square or middle slices geometry. The activation energy (Ea), increased with respect to the charge of material into the dryer. The averages of Eawere no significant difference respect to the geometry but were different respect to the relation of material bulk 0.5 and 1.5. The lowest production cost was obtained in rectangular prisms and half slices with 40.46 $ kg-1 onion.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/40/24

Structural changes and functional properties of native and enzymatically modified α-LA in a pH range from 3 to 10 were analyzed. The degree of modification was higher than 40 %. The enzymatic lipophilization modified the functionality of the α-LA due to the increase in the surface hydrophobicity. In general, the surface properties were improved by the lipophilization specially at alkaline pH values, increasing the emulsifying activity more than 60 % and showing higher foam stability.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/43/27

The results of thermodynamics analysis were confirmed with Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM). Adsorption isotherms of agave fructans were realized at 15, 25 and 45°C. ESEM was performed at the samples equilibrated in a range of water activitie (aw) from 0.1 to 0.9.

We prepared CoMo, NiMo (Co  or Ni =2.4 wt.% and Mo=9.0 wt%) and (x)NiCoMo (x = 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 wt% Ni).  The support and catalysts were characterized and tested in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction of dibenzothiophene (DBT).  The catalytic activity results show that the CoMo and NiMo samples are more active than the trimetallic catalysts  due to a better dispersion of MoS2(lower stacking and length) which induce a higher concentration of CoMoS and NiMoS sites. The HRTEM results also showed that the increase of the Ni concentration causes the increase of  length and stacking of the MoS2slabs. The XPS analysis exhibited that the amount of  Co sulfided species in trimetallic catalysts follows a linear trend with the catalytic activity. The β-KIT-6 bimetallic supported catalysts showed better catalytic activities than those supported on KIT-6 and SBA-15 mesoporous silicas.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/33/18

However, metals used for ultra-dispersed catalysts are expensive, therefore it is necessary to consider different strategies to improve catalysts for heavy oil hydroprocessing. In this study, we have evaluated the catalytic performance of four catalytic emulsion formulations containing molybdenum and nickel and two solid dispersed formulations containing iron. Results showed that at tested conditions, the percentage of converted products for VR 500°C+ and asphaltenes are comparable for emulsion formulations, showing no nickel synergistic effect. Also, VR 500°C+ conversion for iron formulations are comparable with thermal cracking conversion for the same feedstock. Even so, iron formulations had a poorer performance than emulsion formulations, Fe-m showed a 7 wt% coke yield, a 46 wt% VR 500°C+ conversion (higher than emulsion formulations) and 4 wt% liquid yield increase (87 wt%) in comparison with thermal cracking (83 wt%) meaning that this type catalyst could be used to upgrade heavy oil feedstocks at medium severity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/37/21

For this purpose an experimental set up was designed, built and characterized, in which the two-phase flow in an oil platform having the severe slugging can be simulated. The experimental tests were undertaken by changing the superficial velocities of both phases. Pressure transducers and ring conductance probes were used to measure pressure, slug frequency and void fraction; all instruments were connected to a data logger and a PC for the posterior results analysis. The experimental runs executed at different superficial velocities, indicate that these parameters have an important influence in the severe slugging behavior, mainly in the slug frequency and the void fraction.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/41/25

It was observed that, the highest removal efficiencies of COD (91.8%), BOD5 (90.6%), total solids (27.8%), helminth eggs (95.9%) and fecal coliforms (99.9%), were achieved at a HRT of 72 H. However, the electrical energy production in the system (0.0932 V, 1.42×10-5 A, 0.2202 mW/m3) decreased considerably by reducing the volumetric flow rate of the influent, which prevented the correct transport of the substrate to the active parts of the microbial biofilm, thus increasing the internal resistance of the system (6.57 kΩ). The coulombic efficiency of the bioelectrochemical system was 0.0067%.

In this work, scale-up of zeolite A synthesis was carried out from laboratory treating a volume of 100 ml until pilot scale with a volume of 40 L. Silicon and aluminum sources were industrial materials produced in Venezuela, no pretreatment was needed for its use, this is a positive factor for technical and economic feasibility of a commercial process synthesis. A method of empirical approach was used, according to geometric, dynamic, thermal and chemical similarity criteria.

The excess molar volume (VmE) was obtained only for binary systems of solvent and alcohol. It was observed that specific masses of pure liquids varied with temperature from 696.281 kg.m-3(15oC) to 679.761 849 kg.m-3(35oC) for iso-octane; 671.849 kg.m-3(15°C) to 653.533 kg.m-3(35°C), for hexane; 814.228 kg.m-3(15°C) to 798.842 kg.m-3(35°C), for butanol; 790.463 kg.m-3(15°C) to 773.426 kg.m-3(35°C) for isopropanol.

Nowadays, when added in minimal amounts, biodiesel with other organic solvents can produce the stabilization of asphaltenes and waxes. Nevertheless, is not always easy to predict the viscosity reduction effect. In this work, we propose a mixing rule to predict the viscosity reduction effect in extra-heavy crude when a viscosity reducing chemical formulation is incorporated. Theoretical model is made based on the viscosity of a suspended solids system. We start with the hypothesis that asphaltenes are present as a group of solids that moves through the fluid in a two-phase flow system, but in a homogeneous way. Analysis of results show a 95% correlationship between experimental data and theoretical model. This novel equation is useful for heavy crude oil, but also light fluids and suspended solids systems.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/20/8

While bioeconomics is a new approach that emphasizes the efficient and sustainable use of biomass production processes to obtain chemicals, materials and energy. Under this approach, this paper presents the design of a biorefinery of sugarcane molasses to produce lactic acid and a food supplement. The analysis of the design is presented in two parts; first, a dynamic analysis of the fermentation reactor is done for two modes of operation (batch and fed-batch), using an enrichment factor associated to the nutrients concentration, and achieving a maximum productivity of lactic acid of 2.4 g/L/h and a yield of 0.97 kg product/kg substrate. In the second part, an industrial conceptual design of the biorefinery is analyzed, evaluating diverse technical, economic and environmental criteria to determine the sustainability of the production process. With the best process design (in mode fed-batch), a unit production cost of 0.66 US$/kg is obtained, with a return of investment of 62.2% in a recovery period of 1.61 years, and with a low environmental impact index of 0.18 PEI/kg.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/36/20
