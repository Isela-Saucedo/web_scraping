The emulsifying activity (EA), stability (ES), and capacity (EC); foaming capacity (FC) and stability (FS); fat holding capacity (FHC); and solubility (S) were determined. Electric conductivity was used for evaluating the emulsifying properties. Average molecular weights were determined by SDS-PAGE. FC was determined by measuring the percentage increase in volume of the hydrolysates solutions upon stirring, whilst FS was determined by measuring the remaining foam volume after a given period of time. MPHA displayed the best EA (255 µS) (p < 0.05); MPHE showed the best ES (49.14 min) (p < 0.05); MPHA and MPHE exhibited the highest FHC values (6.7 mL/g); and MPHE had the highest FC (62.5%) (p < 0.05). FPH displayed the highest EC (340 g oil/g protein) (p < 0.05). Highest FS was shown by MPHA. In general, the best overall properties were displayed by the maize hydrolysates.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1777/878

EX WILLD) M.C. JOHNST (MESQUITE) CELLS SUSPENSION CULTURE IN BIOREACTOR,"The mesquite gum (MG) production from P rosopis laevigata cells suspension culture in a stirred tank type bioreactor, with characteristics similar to those of MG obtained from wild trees are reported. The cells showed a specific growth rate (µ) of 0.08 1/d and a viability of over 60 %, reaching a maximum biomass of 16.6 g dry mass (dm)/L after 14 d. The cells produced a gum made up by 83.5% of carbohydrates (L-arabinose, D-galactose and glucuronic acid) and 8.1% of protein, also detected arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) as constituents of the gum. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared using as continuous phase aqueous solutions of MG obtained from wild trees and that produced in bioreactor (MGb). The emulsifying capacity of MGb was slightly superior, but the emulsion stability lower, than that obtained with MG.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1781/882

The abundance of pecan nutshells (PNs) and castile nutshells (CNs) provided the motivation for producing GAC from these materials. Phosphoric acid was used at several activation ratios (Rs), and the adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) and phenol (PH) by the products was measured. The highest GAC yields and the maximum adsorption capacities were obtained at R=2. Although the maximum MB adsorption capacity of GAC produced from CNs was relatively small, 170 mg g−1; that of GAC produced from PNs was 400 mg g−1, which is among the highest reported. The SEM images of GAC from PNs revealed an ordered arrangement of nearly straight and tubular macropores with abundant mesopores inside. The ball-pan hardness number of the PN GAC is 80, equal to the value reported for bituminous GAC. These characteristics make the GAC obtained from PNs suitable for packed tower applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1786/885

In this work, a hierarchical structure for the control of an ammonia reactor with cold-shot cooling, which is highly nonlinear and strongly coupled, is proposed. This hierarchical control system has three levels. The first level is composed of PI type controllers, and its main objective is stabilization. The second level is composed of an interpolated controller that provides the reference temperature for the control of the first bed of the reactor. Its objective is to extend the operating range of the controller and therefore, to improve the performance. The Third level is composed of an optimizer whose objective is to maximize the ammonia production. The results show that the hierarchical structure results in a robust and stable controller in a large operating range, keeping the control outputs on its reference while rejecting the disturbances.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1788/888

Asphaltene, precipitated from a Maya Mexican crude oil, was observed by Transmission electron micrographs showing that asphaltene is constituted of nanometric particles smaller than 50 nm in diameter. By changing the concentration of cetylpyridinium chloride, dodecylamine hydrochloride and sodium dodecyl sulphate from 0.01 mM to 1 mM, we were able to reverse and control the sign of the zeta potential of asphaltene, demonstrating the presence of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions at the asphaltene surface. These interactions were also observed by interfacial tension measurements at the toluene - water interface. It has been noticed that for low and high pH in the aqueous phase, the presence of dodecylamine hydrochloride and sodium dodecyl sulphate were not determinant on the asphaltene interfacial tension. On the contrary for pH near the IEP and pH neutral, these surfactants were more effective. The presence of cetylpiridinium hydrochloride in the aqueous phase changed the asphaltene interfacial tension to very low values independent of the pH.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1789/889

In the production of activated carbon, the response surface methodology was used with a central compound design to identify the factors temperature (T) and time (t) of activation that maximize the superficial area of the activated carbon, the activator agent used was vapor of water. The characterization of the obtained carbon under optimum conditions was made using ASTM norms and the chemical method of Bohem to identify superficial functional groups. The optimum conditions of activation of activated carbon are T = 550.98◦C and a t = 122.76 min, superficial area of 917 mg/g. Keeping in mind the optimum conditions of production of activated carbon by physical activation. The quality of the activated carbon has a major effect on its market value.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1790/890

This model focuses on the specific configuration of the boiler (container plus boiling vessel) and the vertical condenser (with an external cooling jacket plus a helical pipe) and also on the effect of atmospheric and subcooling conditions in the condenser. For the sake of flexibility and to represent consistently the semi-continuous conditions during the startup, the equations are solved as a DAEs set. Results are compared with experimental data from a Methanol-Ethanol mixture in a 10-tray distillation column. The effects of configuration and operating conditions on the model fidelity are discussed. The model describes the semi-continuous hydraulics and the desired temperature profile that is expected to be used for process control",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1791/891

The biorefinery concept will be the technological building block of a new biomass-based economy. This article describes the current challenges and opportunities on the development and implementation of biorefineries on a global level, as well as opportunity areas on R&D, aiming to recognise the current and future scenarios of the energetic and economic system in Mexico. A literature review on the energy and food crisis and on the development strategies, production and use of biofuels and biomass over the last decades allowed to make a diagnosis of the current global and national energy situation. A SWOT analysis was performed providing a basis for the formulation of contingency strategies before the risks and problems idiosyncratic to biorefineries. Mexico was identified as being in a privileged position due to its vast natural resources and good capacity for technology innovation, despite of an annual reduction on the national science-and-technology budget and a lack of a national strategy for prioritising the development of biorefineries.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1783/883

The gas void fraction is one of the most important parameters required for the better prediction of production profiles. Eight empirical correlations (Bonnecaze, Dix model, Duns-Ros, Krilov, Hasan, Rouhani, Homogeneous Model and Orkiszewski) for the estimation of gas void fractions and to model their implications on the two-phase flow inside geothermal wells were evaluated. These correlations were assessed through the two-phase flow modeling (using the wellbore simulators GEOPOZO and GEOWELLS) in four producer wells from Mexican geothermal fields: Los Azufres, Mich. (Az-18), Los Humeros, Pue. (H-1), and Cerro Prieto, B.C. (M-90 and M-201). The simulated pressure and temperature profiles were statistically compared with actual field data. An acceptable agreement (< 10%) between the simulated profiles, obtained with the Dix model correlation, and measured data was obtained. These results enabled the modeling of two-phase flow inside geothermal wells to be reliably performed, which constitute an advantage due to the limited number of available correlations to calculate the gas void fraction in geothermal wells.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1785/884
