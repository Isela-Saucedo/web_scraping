The aim of this work was to evaluate their capacity to produce calcium- and ironbinding peptides when grown in culture media with different nitrogen sources. The fermentation media included broths containing tryptic soy (TS), casein peptone (CP), soy peptone (SP), and a crude phycobiliprotein extract (CPE). Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from the fermented media after 24, 48 and 72 h of fermentation and, tested for degree of hydrolysis (DH). Calcium- and iron-binding activities were determined as well. When the inocula were prepared in a medium designed for the production of alkaline proteases (AP), the degree of hydrolysis and the mineral-binding activity in the CFS were higher. The best results for calcium-binding activity and DH were obtained when B. subtilis and B. coagulans grew in a CPE-containing medium. Analogous results were found for the iron-binding activity; nevertheless, this bioactivity was also high for B. clausii when grown in broths containing TS-, CP- and, SP.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1171/465

This carbohydrate accumulates inside the cytosol of yeast during abiotic stress due to its protective eect against desiccation, high temperatures, freezing, high salinity and oxidation. For this reason, trehalose has important applications in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical industries and research. In this study, it was performed a comparative analysis of trehalose production in non-conventional yeasts Saccharomyces kluyveri, Candida shehatae and Candida guilliermondii evaluating the eect of two growth temperatures (28 and 34°C) and two methods of cell breakage (mechanical or thermal disruption by bead beating or boiling, respectively). The growth rate (cells/mL) of the cells cultured at 34°C was lower in comparison with the growth at 28°C. S. kluyveri produced the higher amount of biomass in comparison with the yeasts from the Candida, C. shehatae was the only yeast in which no trehalose production was detected at any temperature. Based on Tukey-Kramer test, it was determined that C. guilliermondii yields the higher amount of trehalose in contrast to the two other species of yeast tested.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1172/466

Its high protein content, distribution and amino acid composition suggests the presence of important peptides encrypted within the sequences of parent proteins, that after been released by digestive process they could show an antioxidant effect. Our present study examined the above hypothesis through the determination of the antioxidant and chelating activity of two Spirulina samples (SpRPh: Spirulina reduced of pholyphenols and PCBEx: extract of phycobiliproteins), subjected both to sequential hydrolysis with pepsin and pancreatin. At the end of the enzymatic action, extensive hydrolysates with a degree of hydrolysis (% DH) of 31.4 and 36.7%, for SpRPh and PCBEx respectively, were obtained. By determining the electrophoretic profiles, the degradation of characteristic bands of Spirulina proteins and the release of smaller peptides were observed. As a general trend, the antioxidant activity determined by different methods improved after simulating gastrointestinal digestion. On the other hand, protein hydrolysates from both groups showed Cu2+ and Fe2+ chelating activity",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1175/471

Peak activity was observed at pH 2, 6, and 8, and 50-60°C, whereas maximum enzymatic stability occurred at pH 2 to 6 (except pH 3) and 0 to 40°C. More than 74% residual activity was retained after heating at 70°C and 80°C for 1 h, confirming the presence of heat-resistant enzymes. The extracts also retained 59% initial activity after 21-day storage at 4-5°C. Hg2+ increased the proteolytic activity in 16%, whereas Cu2+ and Mn2+ caused partial inhibition, suggesting the presence of cysteine- and metallo- proteases. Extracts were inhibited by pepstatin A, β-mercaptoethanol and EDTA, confirming the predominance of aspartyl-, cystein-, and metallo-, proteases. Four proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE (180.6, 114.5, 91.7 and 52.9 kDa). Zymograms on casein confirmed the presence of proteolytic enzymes. After purification by anion exchange chromatography a 49 kDa protease, possible metalloprotease, was detected. Mass spectrometry of the partially purified protein showed homology with trypsin and chain E, leech-derived tryptase inhibitor trypsin complex (LDTI). Due that no homology was found with any previously described metalloproteases, the presence of a novel enzyme is suggested.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1181/474

Its hydrophobic nature do limit its applications, because human body absorbs it with difficulty, that is why it was proposed to increase its bioavailability by diminishing the particle size using supercritical carbon dioxide. It was determined experimentally the phase behavior of the coenzyme in a supercritical system. The equilibrium data and a factorial 2k experimental design were utilized to find how the shape and size of the microparticles are affected by temperature, coQ10 concentration and nozzle diameter. Microparticles were characterized using infrared spectrometry and chromatography. For verify the fundamental chemical structure, the size and the shape of the microparticles was used scanning electronic microscopy. It was found a significant decrease in particle size and a modification of physical structure. The antioxidant power of coQ10 after micronization was measured, showing an increase of this property. Finally, in order to evaluate the bioavailability, the kinetic of solubility was determined in ethanol, having a substantial increase on solubilization speed of micronized coQ10 compared with the commercial one.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1194/479

A composting process for stabilizing residues with high fat content that generate unpleasant odors is presented. Laboratory experiments were carried out for determining the appropriate process parameters, and scaled-up for the in situ process. Laboratory tests with cattle manure showed a reduction in the production of malodorous gases in three weeks. The resulting compost complied with national and international standards, and can be used in 1:3 compost:soil ratio for soil improvement. The waste stabilized in situ complied with most parameters established in the Mexican regulation (NOM-FF-109-SCFI-2007), excepting pH (9.6) and electrical conductivity (5 dS/m).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1208/485

The remnant starch granules were studied in the morphological, thermal, and molecular features. Two reagents were tested to carried out the surface gelatinization; 13 M lithium chloride produced higher damage than 2 M calcium chloride on structure of starch granule, so calcium chloride was used to carried out surface gelatinization at different reaction times. Gelatinized surface increased and the granule size decreased when the reaction time increased. In general, the average temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization decreased when the removed surface increased, showing disorganization or “weakening” of the granule structure. However, surface gelatinization did not affect the X-ray diffraction pattern and the crystallinity level. Knowledge of the organization of plantain starch components (amylose and amylopectin), support to explain the physicochemical, functional and digestibility characteristics, as well as its reactivity when the plantain starch is enzymatic and chemical modified",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1214/490

The physicochemical properties (color evaluation and proximate analysis, quantifying of total and resistant starch and the apparent amylose content) were studied and the thermal properties were determined, pasting, rheological and functional using differential scanning calorimetry, rapid visco-analysis of viscosity, flow curves at steady state, swelling power, solubility and stability to freeze-thawing, respectively. Among the flours and starches no significant difference was observed, however the digestibility was higher in starch, indicating the presence of other compounds which can encourage digestibility, which was confirmed in the proximal and in the determination of electron microscopy analysis sweep. Flour and starch had the highest cv Cuauhtémoc  ∆H compared with the flour and starch Bach´ıniva and Teporaca. The functional properties of freeze-thawing stability increased with increasing number of cycles; however, decreased when the temperature increased. These varieties could find any practical application in various food systems and could be a potential food source for people with eating disorders (v. gr. celiac patients).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1216/492

In this study a process for preliminary purification of anthocyanins from blue corn (Zea mays) was implemented. The anthocyanin purification advancement was analysed in terms of Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Anthocyanin Content (TAC), and reverse phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Microfiltration and ultrafiltration steps were used as pretreatment of the extracts. Purification of anthocyanins was performed by adsorption and electrophoresis. The adsorption was achieved using a (SP-207) styrene-divinylbenzene resin, the results were correlated using Freundlich and Langmuir models. The best condition for purification of anthocyanins in electrophoresis was at pH 3 and 220 V. The purification process was improved using electrophoresis resulting in a decreasing on TOC from 59.52±0.53 mg to 3.966±0.257 mg per milligram of anthocyanins. The process implemented was successfully used in red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. Capitata) and blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum).

However, mineral exploitation is extensive, leading to a considerable generation of waste that has accumulated without any control. The present study used historical tailings from Guanajuato mining district, in the towns of Monte San Nicolas and Peregrina. Batch leaching tests were performed with three different methodologies: PECT method (extraction procedure toxic constituents) described in the NOM053-SEMARNAT-1993, the NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003 (CO2 acidified water) and the SPLP (Synthetic Precipitation leaching Procedure) 1312 (EPA, 1989). The elements studied were: As, Pb, Mn, Zn, Cd and Cr. According to variance analysis, there were significant differences between the types of extractant. The results show that the release of Pb and Zn in the waste is a function of the pH of the extractant. The release for As, Zn, Cd and Cr depend on the degree of adsorption to manganese and aluminum oxides. For all elements studied the release was greater with the TCLP extract, influenced by the acidity and the organic ligand.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1227/497

CASE: TREATMENT WASTEWATER PLANT OF SALAMANCA, SPAIN","Photolysis (UV-C radiation) and heterogeneous photocatalysis (UV-C/TiO2/SiO2) were used to inactivate E. coli and total coliform bacteria in biologically treated municipal wastewater. A 50 L sample was used with a recirculation rate of 1000 L/h through a UV photo reactor for 150 min reaction time, at a constant temperature. Samples were taken at different time intervals from each experimental run, then the colony forming units were counted, and the inactivation kinetic reaction was determined in a 2x2 factorial design with co-variable and replicates. The inactivation rate constants for coliform bacteria obtained in both processes, photolysis and photocatalysis, showed total E. coli and total coliform bacteria inactivation in short reaction times. ANOVA (p < 0.05) showed a significant effect for the Advanced Oxidation Process, bacteria and the co-variable (initial colony forming units). Comparison of the bacteria inactivation constant rates in short treatment times, obtained by t-Student test, demonstrated that photolysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis showed a significant difference (p < 0.05), allowing both techniques to fulfill the Spanish regulations for E. coli.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1228/498

The copper mine tailing was calcined at 900° C during 2 hours in a 1:1.5 (w/w) ratio. Then, hydrothermal treatment was applied at 60° C in a 0.172 g/mL ratio. Several times of synthesis were evaluated, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 66 and 72 hours. According to the Cationic Exchange Capacity (CEC), 36 hours of time was selected as optimal time. A zeolitic material with 93.77% of zeolite P and 3.85% of cancrinite was obtained with a CEC=2.016 meq/g. The CEC obtained is an excellent value to remove heavy metals presents in water and soils. The use of copper mine tailing to synthesize zeolites is a friendly environmental option to prevent the generation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD).

The proposed observer contains a standard proportional term and a bounded feedback that improves the performance of the estimation process compared with other methodologies such as extended Luenberger-type observers. A theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed observer through an analysis of multiple Lyapunov functions is provided. The estimation strategy is applied to a bioreactor batch, where is performed a process of sulfate-reducing considering a hypothetical change in kinetic regime. The evolution of the reaction kinetics is described in three stages: the first stage is described by the Haldane-Boulton kinetic model; the second transitional stage called an interaction between the Haldane-Boulton and Moser-Boulton kinetic models; and the third stage is represented by the model Moser-Boulton. Sulfide concentration is considered as a measured variable of the bioreactor to implement the proposed observer.

Furthermore, it is considered that the biomass yield can be modeled as a constant or a variable case, for the variable case, a substrate dependent Gaussian-type function was proposed. The proposed non-conventional yield function is a realistic approach that describes the behavior of the cellular yield, unlike other models, this one is bounded to the maximum cellular yield and can be extrapolated to several operation conditions. Numerical results show changes in the equilibrium branches due to the kinetic growth model used. The non-conventional model of biomass yield produces a shift in the steady state multiplicity intervals, and new limit cycles were found with certain specific values of dilution rate and substrate feed",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1230/500
