In this workA. flavusCECT-2687 grew in submerged cultures on different monosaccharides, polysaccharides or agricultural residues, at several initial pH values, in order to identify the effect of these factors on xylanases and pectinases production. Results shown that this production is strongly dependent on the initial pH of the culture (is better at pH values between 6 and 8), as much as the composition and availability of polysaccharides used as carbon source. At this respect, on monosaccharides only xylanases were produced, although the highest xylanolytic activities were obtained on agroindustrial xylan-rich residues. Exopectinases titers were similar on polysaccharides and agricultural residues. This strain produced also high pectin lyases titers on agricultural residues. Electrophoretic pattern of crude extracts from lemon peel cultures at initial pH of 8 showed a protein band corresponding to a pectin lyase of around 27 KDa.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/49/33

Response surface methodology was applied to these four quality characteristics. A central composite rotatable (CCR) experimental design with two factors [Germination temperature (GT, 25-40°C)/Germination time (Gt, 25-360 h)] in 5 levels was used (13 treatments). The prediction models developed for each response variable showed high coefficients of determination, demonstrating their adequacy to explain the variations in experimental data. The germination bioprocess at optimal conditions increased PC, AoxA, and TPC, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids content, and decreased LC concerning the entire seed. Germination is an effective strategy to increase the TPC of moringa seeds for enhancing functionality with improved antioxidant activity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/59/43

Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology has been developed to completely remove nitrogen in one single reactor combining aerobic and anoxic stages. In this work, pre-fermentation of 7 days under anaerobic conditions was carried out; achieving 78% of protein hydrolysis, 138 mg NH4+-N/L was produced and 53% of CODsolublewas diminished. Bio-degradability assays under oxic/anoxic (O/A) and anoxic/oxic (A/O) conditions using pre-fermented wastewater were performed; raw slaughterhouse wastewater was used as control assay. Low values of protein hydrolysis and removal efficiencies of COD were obtained with pre-fermented wastewater: (O/A) 44% and 46%, and (A/O) 34% and 54%, respectively; whereas with the raw wastewater the hydrolysis and COD removal efficiencies were above 60%. Higher removal efficiencies of total nitrogen were obtained with pre-fermented wastewater under O/A conditions (60%). The pre-fermentation was not able to improve the biodegradability; however, the treatment of raw wastewater under A/O conditions produced an effluent with quality to be discharged in according to Mexican Normative.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/73/49

The aqueous phase consisted of 4% alginate and the oil phase consisted of mineral oil and Span 80 at 1%. The microparticles were manufactured at 250 rpm, at 20°C for 30 min. The relative survival of the free microorganism was not detectable at the end of the stress period. In contrast, despite the stress-induced disintegration of the microparticles, the relative survival ofL. acidophilusLA-5 was 46.9%. The generated microparticles had the ability to protect and liberate probiotics, making then suitable for use as protective agents for probiotics sensitive to gastrointestinal stress, which may have applications in the food or pharmaceutical industries.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/75/51

Merrill) from an edible film formulated withAloe vera, gelatin and glycerol. The analysis was done for three concentrations of essential oil (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% w/w) and at two temperatures (5 ° C and 25 ° C) for a period of 180 hours, taking samples at various times to measure the concentration of the essential oil whose eugenol is the main component. The governing equations were obtained from Fick´s second law. The predictions of the eugenol concentration were compared with the experimental values using a least squares scheme, where the diffusion coefficient and the mass transfer coefficient were estimated using Levenberg-Marquardt method. The effective diffusivity of eugenol is between 7.0529∙10-12to 5.3586∙10-11m²/h at 5 °C, while at 25 °C, the effective diffusivity values ​​are between 3.7980∙10-11to 5.2578∙10-10m²/h. These values ​​are in agreement with those reported for other similar systems and indicate that the diffusive transport of the essential oil through the edible film studied is a slow process, a required condition to increase the shelf life of foods where these films can be used as coatings in meat products and cheeses.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/55/39

BiDASys has the following novel aspects: the statistical capability of detecting discordant outliers in bivariate data; new simulated critical values generated through our Monte Carlo simulation procedure for the probability of no-correlation in multivariate samples of sizes n=5–1000; and the only available software that can successfully achieve the application of the new UWLR model to the experimental data. The use of BiDASys is illustrated through three case studies from Glera-Prosecco (Italy), Quebec (Canada), and Tuscany to Basilicata (Italy), which confirms that the Sr isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr) can be used to track the geographical origin of wine (grapes plantation) and one more case study concerning the organochlorine pesticide levels in breast milk from Guerrero (Mexico).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/56/40

The milk samples contained different ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids of 0.7, 0.86, and 1.36 (MF1, MF2, and MF3, respectively), and a hydrolyzed milk fat sample (90% free fatty acids) with a ratio of 1.40 (MF4). The thermoxidation has been conducted under non-isothermal oxidation from 380 to 520K using five different heating rates (3, 6, 9, 12and 15 K min-1). The Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method was used to calculate the activation energy as a function of the extend of themroxidation. The obtained dependencies were interpreted in terms of oxidation mechanisms. The activation energy values were 100.10, 84.53, 80.41, and 121.44 kJ mol-1for MF1, MF2, MF3, and MF4, respectively. The thermoxidaiton of milk fat in the form of triacylglycerol was best described by Avrami-Erofeev model (A3), while the thermoxidation of free fatty acids was described by a frist-order model (F1). The calculated kinetic triplet were used to simulate the thermoxidation of milk fat and showed good agreement with the experimental data.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/70/46

The glass flask containing CB was maintained in the coffeemaker hot-plate at 75OC. The antioxidant activity was monitored and assayed during 8 h by means of DPPH, FRAP, total phenols content, browning index and voltammetry. Antioxidant activity showed a fast increase during the first 1.0-1.5 h.  Heating times longer than about 2 h produced nearly constant values for FRAP, total phenols and caffeine contents, but DPPH and oxidative capacity by voltammetry decreased probably due to the oxidation of antioxidant compounds by environmental stress. It was postulated that Maillard reactions products were formed in the heated CB, probably due to the degradation of CGAs that complexed with proteins/polysaccharides, giving way to potent antioxidants compounds such as melanoidins. The results of this work showed that the antioxidant activity increased with CB heating time.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/72/48

Hydration at atmospheric 13 pressure was modeled by the first order kinetics model and by the Fick’s second law of 14 diffusion. Rate constants of 0.192, 0.184 and 0.141 h-1, and water effective diffusivity of 5.4 15 x10-11, 3.6 x10-11, and 1.9 x10-11m2 s-1 were obtained for blue, yellow and white corn kernel, 16 respectively. Significant polynomial equations described the corn kernels hydration under 17 pressure gradients, as a function of vacuum pressure, vacuum time and hydration time. 18 Hydration rates of the studied grains were significantly enhanced using the pressure 19 gradients, compared to the conventional method. Pressure gradient soaking required 60% 20 less time than the conventional soaking, to reach a water content of 45% in corn kernels. The 21 hydration extent of corn kernels determined the levels of solutes leaching, in both soaking 22 treatments.

Samples with freezable and unfreezable moisture were prepared and analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), with which freezing points (Tm, Tm’) and glass transition temperatures (Tg, Tg’) were determined. An average Tgvalue of 61.5±6.4°C was found for anhydrous escamoles. Samples containing unfreezable water, however, showed no glass transition. The maximal-freeze-concentration condition was determined at the values ofxs’=0.870 g solid/g sample, Tm´= -22.7°C and Tg’= -30.7°C. The stability of frozen escamoles was tested based on the application of their corresponding Tg´ value. Therefore, escamoles were frozen at -20, -35 and -80°C for four months, and quality parameters such as thawing loss, protein and lipid oxidation and structural changes in thawed escamoles were evaluated. Results (p<0.05) showed that chemical and structural changes were mainly detected in samples stored at -20°C. Thus, a storage temperature of -35°C is recommended for the long-term stability of fresh escamoles.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/83/58

However, they are very sensitive to pro-oxidant conditions, heat and light. Previous attempts have been made to improve bioavailability and stability of carotenoids, of which emulsions have proven to help a feasible method. Conventional (CE) and nano (NE) emulsions loaded with paprika oleoresin carotenoids (POC; 1 % wt/wt) were fabricated using surfactants blend (Tween 40 and Span 20) with a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), ranging from 12 to 15.6, and surfactant: POC ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt). POC bioaccessibility was studied using an in vitro model to simulate oral, gastric and small intestine phases of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In general, higher HLB values produced CE's and NE's with smaller particle size and negative value of zeta potential.  The smaller the droplet size, the higher was POC bioaccessibility. NE prepared with a HLB of 15.6 had a particle size of 38.93 nm and a bioaccessibility of 74%. Bioaccessibility of unemulsified POC was practically nil.

The e-Caprolactam (precursor for nylon-6) was the major product on the whole temperature range studied and Cyclohexanone appeared as the main by-product and was generated probably due to the moderate acidity of these materials. The stability and the possibility of recycling of the catalyst were also analyzed. So, the catalyst could be used during 3600 min and then recovered and reused without significant changes in the active species. A reaction pathway was proposed in order to explain the results obtained. Finally, the better catalytic performance was observed at 320 °C and W/F = 40 gh/mol. Such conditions allowed us to achieve a Cyclohexanone oxime conversion of 54% with an e-Caprolactam selectivity of around 83%. Thus, under this soft reaction condition it could be achieved a high yield to e-Caprolactam with a low proportion of Cyclohexanone. This product mixture (e-Caprolactam and Cyclohexanone) may be separated by vacuum distillation; then the Cyclohexanone could be recycled by reaction with hydroxylamine to form again Cyclohexanone oxime (raw material for e-Caprolactam), marketed for the production of adipic acid,  as adhesive in sealing PVC objects or as solvent in several industries.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/74/50

The material obtained was applied as adsorbent for whey protein purification, using ß-lactoglobulin as the model molecule. The coconut endocarp was initially subjected to leaching in alkaline medium. The activated carbon (AC) was prepared by the chemical activated method using ZnCl2as activating agent. The yield of the synthesis process and the physical and chemical properties of the carbon were determined. In addition, the effects of various factors such as the pH, the carbon mass, the time, and temperature on the adsorption performance was investigated. The activated carbon showed a pore size distribution in the mesoporous range and high surface area. The adsorption tests evidenced that the AC had the best performance at pH 3.0. The pseudo second-order kinetics model set better to the experimental data of β-lg adsorption onto AC and Langmuir model was more appropriate to represent the experimental data, with maximum adsorption capacity of 524.76 mg/g, evidencing the potential of the coconut endocarp waste for production of activated carbon for the purification of whey proteins.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/53/37

In all the cases, the HTlc were obtained free of crystalline impurities, this was confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) with crystal sizes between 0.96-1.93 nm and specific surface areas from 35 to 75 m2/g. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) different morphologies were identified: laminar, hexagonal and structures in the shape of a needle; the morphologies depend on the irradiation method and the metallic combination. The Band gap (Eg) values were lower than 3.0 eV, this allows their activation with visible light. The XRD of calcined HTlc support that the reflections correspond to mixed oxides of Cu, Ga and Zn. The calcined and uncalcined synthesized samples were evaluated in a combined adsorption-photodegradation process of the mixture Cr(VI)-naphthalene using visible light. It was found that the best tested material was the HTlc ZnGa calcined and synthesized by ultrasonic irradiation. This HTlc ZnGa was able to degrade the mixture of both contaminants up to 98% in comparison with the 35% of the commercial TiO2anatase phase.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/78/54

The study is based on two approaches to describe the nucleation (homogeneous primary and secondary) and growth kinetics, and the birth and death rates of crystals: a) empirical models with equations of type power law (TPL) and b) mechanistic approach with thermodynamic equations. Both approaches describe the phenomena of crystallization at the microscopic level (by solving population balance equation by method of lines) and were validated using experimental data from pilot-scale plant. From the results of both approaches and experimental validation, we conclude that mechanistic approach best represents the dynamic behavior of cane sugar batch crystallization under different operational conditions than the empirical approach (TPL).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/47/31

In oil refining, there are fractions that may contain contaminants that use them directly is complicated. This study studied the acid purification of an aliphatic hydrocarbon to obtain a solvent that is applied in the coatings industry. The introduction section defined the problem related to the limited supply of solvents; In addition, rigorous control procedures to be met by the company handling solvents considered chemical precursors; consequently, the objective of this study was to obtain an alternative aliphatic solvent through a chemical process. The material and methods section, details the raw materials used: aliphatic hydrocarbon, sulphuric acid, sodium hydroxide and filtering earth. In the experimental design three treatments were made and the variation of the amount of acid was considered as a factor.

Recently, a novel method to produce rGO has been proposed, which consists on the exposure of GO to microwave irradiation. However, the mechanisms of reduction and exfoliation of GO by using this technique are not clear yet. In this work, the reduction and exfoliation of GO by using microwaves was analyzed with a focus on the water content that allows a successful process. For this, three samples of commercial GO were exposed to different atmospheric conditions and further irradiated in a commercial microwave oven. The samples were characterized before and after irradiation by using different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the water trapped in the samples is the key parameter for a successful reduction and exfoliation of GO by using microwaves. The reduction and exfoliation of GO were macroscopically visible as a significant volume change and color, as well as an increase in conductivity and further corroborated by spectroscopic techniques. For the conditions utilized in this work, the amount of water in GO samples required for a successful process was estimated as 5 wt% of the sample.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/51/35

Samples of ZnO nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction, UV/Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and N2adsorption-desorption. It was observed from SEM analysis that ZnO nanoparticles with morphologies resembling six-blade impeller with diameters in the range of 500 nm to 1 mm, and sheet-like (approximately 200 × 300 nm) were obtained through this technique. X-Ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirmed the obtaining of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal structure.

The effect of the type of inorganic precursor on the formation of silica particles was studied. Composite membranes were prepared by casting technique from these organic-inorganic materials. These membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The morphology, particle size and particle-polymer interaction were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, a semi-quantitative chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed the chemical composition of the composite membranes. Type and concentration of silica precursor affected the morphology, particle size and distribution of silica in the composite membranes. Composite membranes with no interfacial voids were obtained from APTES at 25 wt%. Initial studies about the gas separation properties of CO2/CH4gas mixture revealed an improvement on the CO2permeability of composite membrane comprising silica particles synthesized from APTES in comparison with the polymeric membrane.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/79/55

There are many variants regarding specimen shape, although the preferred shape is a flat-end cylindrical probe. However, mathematical and physical modeling studies, carried out under isothermal conditions, regarding the hydrodynamic behavior of the quenchant around flat-end cylindrical probes suggest that this type of probe should not be recommended for studies quenching.  In this paper, we study fluid dynamics around an instrumented flat-end cylindrical probe, both under isothermal (unheated probe) and non-isothermal conditions (probe heated to 900 ºC and cooled in water at 60 ºC). For this purpose, water at 60 ° C was used as cooling fluid; three free-stream flow velocities (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 m/s) were studied. Visualization techniques using a high-speed camera and optical filters were applied to characterize the flow around the probe and, at the same time, thermal histories were measured within the probe. The results show that fluid dynamics under non-isothermal conditions is very different from that under isothermal conditions; therefore, it is not advisable to directly correlate fluid dynamics around metal probes characterized under isothermal conditions with cooling curves or the evolution of the wetting front during an actual quench.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/80/56

In this work, two groups of eco-composites of cellulose acetate matrix reinforced with cellulose and curauá fibers were prepared by extrusion and injection method. The first group of eco-composites, were prepared on laboratory scale, with curauá fibers, virgin and treated by two different methods; extraction with acetone and mercerized. A second group of materials was obtained on pilot scale, for which cellulose fibers and curauá fibers treated with acetone were used at different times of extraction. The acetone treatment was selected because in the first group, the materials with these fibers presented better mechanical properties, and mainly for their lower thermal conductivity (0.132 W m-1K-1), compared to those from untreated fibers (0.178 W m-1K-1) and treated with NaOH (0.255 W m-1K-1). The eco-composites prepared on a pilot scale with curauá fibers previously treatment with acetone for 5 days presented a better balance of their thermal and mechanical properties, which could allow their use as thermal insulation with high mechanical performance (thermal conductivity = 0.097 W m-1K-1and modulus of elasticity = 2.2 GPa).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/58/42

The observer is based on a simplified mathematical model. The model is expressed in terms of organic matter, biomass and volatile fatty acids concentrations. It involved a Monod and Haldane kinetics modified included temperature and pH inhibitory effects. The observer shows a good performance for the estimation of substrate and biomass concentration at the outlet of the bioreactor, and the maximum growth rates. The estimation is made from the measurement of the volatile fatty acids concentration at the outflow stream. The observer performance is tested by numerical simulations and a non-linear least squares method is used for model calibration. The results showed a good agreement with experimental data, it evidences the reliability of the observer to estimate states and variables, which implies a minimization of the parametric model uncertainty.
