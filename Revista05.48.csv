The use of clean energies in Wastewater Treatments Plants would decrease the operating costs. In the present work, a solar heater of 8 tubes was used for controlling the temperature of an UASB reactor in order to treat a mixture of industrial wastewater under anaerobic digestion. The reactor was operated at three temperatures (16, 20, and 30 ºC), at organic loading rate of 11 g COD/L-d, HRT of 6 h, and during a period of 100 days. In addition, the effect of a co-substrate on COD consumption was evaluated, in batch cultures. In the steady-state, COD removal efficiencies were 8.6, 20, and 40 %, for 16, 20, and 30 ºC, respectively. Increasing the temperature enhanced the methane production, achieving in average 257 ± 8.6 ml CH4/ g COD removed. In batch cultures, 200 and 400 mg glucose/L used as co-substrate significantly improved the removal and COD consumption rates. Finally, a solar heater might be feasible and economical technology for temperature-control of an UASB reactor in order to improve the organic matter removal.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1853/955

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acidogenesis/methanogenesis of acid cheese whey with short Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) in Hybrid-UASB reactors, following the organic matter, ammonia, and orthophosphate evolution. The acidogenic reactor was operated at HRT of 0.5 days, while for the methanogenic reactor, ranged from 1‒2 days; both reactors were operated in series. Results show that the overall HRT of 1.5 days allowed optimal removal (89‒96.8%) with organic loading rates between 2.5 and 10.7 g COD/L-d, while at 14.2‒24.9 g COD/L-d best results were found at 2.5 days of overall HRT. Highest methane productivity ranged from 0.99‒1.15 LCH4/LReactor-d (0.238‒0.308 LCH4/g CODdegraded). Ammonia formation was only significant in methanogenesis (85 mg/L), while orthophosphates showed no change throughout all the process. In conclusion Hybrid-UASB reactors operated at short HRT were suitable for the acidogenesis/methanogenesis of this wastewater. Furthermore, methane can be used for energy generation, and ammonia and orthophosphate might be employed for the development of high value-added products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1420/1001

Moreover, we present several preventive and recovery strategies for each stage considering the detected inhibition indicator. Some of the preventive strategies are the acclimation of microorganisms to degrade organic-matter in the presence of certain inhibitors, the enrichment of the inoculum with various additives (e.g., sulfate-reducing bacteria, electron donors, mineral adsorbents or nutrients), the dilution of the influent, and the prior removal of the inhibitors. Some of the proposed recovery strategies are the reduction of the inhibitor concentration by removal strategies (e.g., precipitation, adsorption, and sulfate-reduction), intermittent feeding, and decrease of the total influent volume. Lastly, we present the challenges and future perspectives of applying the inhibition indicators and control strategies, e.g., the importance of developing straightforward and low-cost technologies for the monitoring of the various parameters or even for the design of anaerobic treatment systems, including an automatized monitoring system of the parameters proposed as inhibition indicators.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1221/751

Its presence in the environment could produce acute or chronic poisoning for people who use it for daily agricultural activities as well as for people who get in contact with polluted soil, water, air or food. In this context, proposing alternatives to accelerate OP degradation processes is important. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate for 28 days the degradation process of PFF in soils with 50 mg PFF/kg (pH = 7.20 + / - 0.31) usingEisenia foetida(EF) and native bacteria (NB). The ""control group"" showed a PFF degradation of 52.95 +/- 1.69% in sterilized soils. NB achieved a degradation of 63.60 +/- 3.27%, EF degraded PFF by 72.65 +/- 1.92% and the combination of EF and NB, 79.21 +/- 1.79%. Bacteria with potential PFF degradation capacity were isolated and identified asKlebsiella oxytocaandPseudomonas aeruginosa. It was shown that EF play an important role by accelerating the degradation of PFF in soils, presenting a possible synergy withKlebsiella oxytocaandPseudomonas aeruginosa.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1505/919

The physicochemical properties of contaminants, along with soil characteristics and ageing, translate into an unusual sorption that leads to high sequestration and low bioavailability. In the present study, fresh (non-sterile) and aged (sterile) synthetic soils (sand-perlite 1:1 v/v) were characterized and spiked (hexadecane, phenanthrene and pyrene 2:1:0.5) to evaluate sequestration extents. Hydrocarbons extraction differed for sand and perlite in fresh samples, on the contrary, the artificial ageing process affected equally the extraction in the synthetic soil components. In the synthetic soil, the extractability of hexadecane and phenanthrene were 80% and 60%, respectively, in fresh samples, but for both hydrocarbons it was only 20% in aged samples. Pyrene extractability was not affected by the components of the synthetic soil or by ageing, and this may be related to an in-situ crystallisation process. The characteristics of the soil and its contaminants, coupled with long-term interactions, significantly modified the PAHs environmental fate, leading to the formation of non-extractable residues, also known as sequestered contaminants. This study expands current knowledge about the fate of these contaminants and should serve as motivation for further experimental and theoretical research on this subject.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1525/936

Endophyte-assisted phytoremediation is a feasible alternative to reduce PAH pollution in soils more efficiently than plants or microorganisms individually. Endophytes can improve the growth, fitness, and antioxidant system of their hosts, especially under stress, including contamination. In this context, this study aimed to assess the influence ofLewiasp. on antioxidant defense and the hydrocarbon removal byF. arundinaceaduring 45 days of exposure to a hydrocarbon mixture. Plant growth and lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in a kinetic assay. The association significantly improved the hydrocarbon removal over a 45-day period, while promoting plant growth and controlling oxidative damage, particularly in the roots. The root antioxidant system inF. arundinaceais itself effective in counteracting the phytotoxicity of direct contact with hydrocarbons. However,Lewiasp. controls LPO in the roots, which may be a consequence of the fungus's own antioxidant system, involving the coordinated activity of SOD and POD. Once the endophytic association is established, it can be applied to phytoremediate PAH-polluted soils during a minimum period of 45 days.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1547/933

An ovoid geometry for the biodigester was chosen, and with the scale factor and geometric relationships were developed equations to scaling geometrically the biodigester, building thebiodigester.slxprogram for the calculates in Simulink (Matlab® software). Seventeen process variables were identified and by means of the dimensional analysis accord to the p theorem of Vaschy-Buckingham were correlated to generate the dimensionless numbers of Geometry, Reynolds, Power, Recirculation, and Damköhler I. The dimensionless functions and dimensionless numbers allowed developing expressions for power consumption and the biogas production volumetric rate from the recirculation velocity and hydraulic recirculation rate, respectively. The above was done considering the next three aspects, the behavior of the wastewater as non-Newtonian fluid, the sludge and manure concentration, and the mixing effect by hydraulic recirculation of the wastewater. Further, from the similitude principles of geometry, kinematic, dynamic, and chemical were established criteria and equations for scaling of recirculation velocity, the power consumption, and the biogas production volumetric rate.

The sampling points were Chajir Lagoon, Puente de Dios, Tampaón River and Media Luna Lagoon, and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a carbon number between C8-C32 were found. We reported high concentrations of pollutants, such as eicosane (up to 2,603.22 ± 1,202.09 mg L-1) and heneicosane (up to 3,971.21 ± 2,260.45 mg L-1). The airlift bioreactor was designed based on hydrodynamic parameters: holdup gas (εG), Sauter mean diameter (d32) and Reynolds number (Re) that increased with the superficial gas velocity (Ug), both in the riser zone and downcomer zone and from Ug = 1.92 cm s-1, mixing and mass transfer are favoured in a 2 L airlift reactor. Also, the hydrodynamic parameters evaluated were higher in the riser zone. Furthermore, the consortium isolated by the Gutiérrez-Rojas working group composed ofXanthomonassp.,AcinetobacterBouvetii,ShewanellaSp., andDefluvibacterlusatiensis, was able to consume 98.21% of the initial diesel concentration (13,000 mg L-1).

This work describes three experimental cases:Aspergillus brasiliensisattached to perlite for emulsifier protein production,Metarhizium anisopliaeas a biologic control of insect pests and the characterization of a hydrocarbon contaminated soil. The standardized methodology is independent of the biotechnological purposes and consists of: (i) establishment of current density in which porous media behaved as an electric resistance (0–2.5, 0-0.6 and 0-0.85 mA cm-2, for perlite, rice-corn mixture and soil, respectively). (ii) establishment of a current density in which cell potential is constant, to make sure that no gradient of nutrients concentration is formed and (iii) pH gradient evaluation as a consequence of water oxidation/reduction electrochemical reactions and the charge transport capability across the porous media. As a result of the aforementioned standardization three sections of packed porous media on electrochemical cell would be obtained: anodic (acidified), middle (neutral) and cathodic (alkalinized), which have different physicochemical properties and promote also different metabolic responses when they are used as supports for solid-state culture.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1689/958

A 450-mL electrochemical cell (EC) with titanium ruthenium-oxide coated electrodes and packed with a mixture of rice:corn stubble, was inoculated with 1x106conidia (g of initial dry support)-1and incubated for 8 days (30ºC). Four days after starting the culture, a current density of 0.09 mA/cm2was applied for 24 h. The moisture kept constant (75%), with and without electric field. With electric field, conidiation (4.9x108± 3.7x107conidia (g of initial dry support)-1) did not show significant differences, but their viability and germination (67 and 45%, respectively) were lower than in the non-perturbated conidia. Total mortality ofTenebrio molitorlarvae provoked by conidia produced in presence of the electric field was 40% higher compared to that provoked by the conidia control.

The effect of the association between endophytic fungus (Lewiasp.) andFestuca arundinaceaon the tolerance and accumulation of lead (Pb) was studied after 45 days of culture in contaminated soil. The tolerance to 2,500 mg Pb Kg-1was quantified by biomass production and the accumulation of lead in shoots and roots. The phytoremediation potential was quantified by estimating the tolerance index (TI), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF). The Pb accumulation in roots (14 ± 4.2 mg g-1), was 3-fold higher in plants inoculated in comparison with only plant (3.73 ± 0.64 mg g-1); The TI was 0.76 and 0.56, the BCF was 0.31 and 0.23 for inoculated and non-inoculated plants, respectively. The TF was not detected in both cases, indicates that when working with this association there is not risk of trophic transfer of lead, according to parameters obtained,Lewiasp. improved growth and tolerance ofF. arundinaceain Pb contaminated soil.

These microorganisms require a supply of nutrients and light to stimulate their growth; and through variations of these factors, it is possible to improve lipid synthesis, fundamental elements for the production of value-added products. The BG11 culture medium was replaced with a urine-based medium (MOB) to cultivate a microalgae of the genusChlorella sp,native to the State of Nuevo León. The growth of the microalgae in MOB was increased when compared to its growth in BG11. An improvement was also observed in the production of fatty acids and proteins, where the cultivation ofChlorella sp. with the urine medium (MOB) showed an average production (%) of 17.22% saturated fatty acids (SUFA's), 22.03% of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA's) and 60.73% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's), demonstrated also in the high concentrations of mainly linoleic and linoleic fatty acids in the microalgae.

Microbial biosensor technology resolved these constraints by offering the most rapid, sensitive, reliable and cost-effective technology, especially in a bioavailable context. This study describes the growth characterisation and optimisation of three differentlux-marked biosensors and their induction bioassay, thus testing their responses to doses of target hydrocarbons (naphthalene, toluene, Isopropylbenzene) and solution of mixed hydrocarbons. These biosensors,Pseudomonas fluorescenceHK44,Escherichia coliHMS174 andPseudomonas putidaTVA8 harboursluxCDABE reporter genes coupled to induction by hydrocarbons. Biosensors harvested at optimal exponential phase and induced with hydrocarbon using the optimised assay conditions are highly sensitive and responsive to their inducers in a proportionate dose-dependent status. The established dose responses of these catabolic biosensors signify the prospect of extrapolation for estimating the genuine contamination loading of pollutants for environmental relevance. However, several factors may contribute to the quenching effect at high concentration of inducers. Robust responsiveness to mixed hydrocarbon solution has been also realised accentuating its feasibility in analysing of real environmental samples containing heterogenous pollutants. This study emphasises the suitability of bioluminescent bacterial biosensors for pollutants analysis and notably the detection of soluble bioavailable fractions of diverse hydrocarbons, hence, serves as a reliable bioindicator of hydrocarbon pollution in an environment. Even so, the real value of biosensors is for a suite of ecologically justified biosensors to be applied in complementary combinations with other focused analytical or chemical methods for broad and resourceful inference.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1274/743

Initially, the virus was referred to as 2019-nCoV.  Subsequently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named it the SARS-CoV-2 virus because it is significantly similar to the causative agent of (SARS-CoVs). All Nidovirales’s viruses are positive-sense non-segmented and enveloped viruses. They have big genomes for the RNA viruses. The critical differences in the families of Nidovirus are noted in the type, sizes, and the number of structural proteins. The variances cause substantial alterations in the morphology and structure of the virions and nucleocapsids. Currently, the COVID- 19 diseases have recorded the most significant number of deaths and cases as compared to other kinds of coronaviruses. In conclusion, since the outbreak of (COVID-19) disease in China, the illness is spreading very quickly across the globe.

Due to this reason, poultry industry needs to add potent phytase in its feed for faster growth rates. Therefore, phytase producing fungal isolates (64) were isolated and subjected to submerged fermentation and maximum production (21.79± 0.05 U/mL/min) was obtained by fungal isolate UJIIB-29, which was identified asAspergillus oryzaeafter18S rRNA sequencing. Under optimized conditions, best results were obtained using glucose phosphate broth as a medium after 7 days of incubation, at 30℃, pH 5.5 with 0.5% glucose and 0.3% ammonium sulfate as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively when it was inoculated with 4% conidial suspension. Purification of phytase by anion exchange chromatography resulted in 89.8% yield, 1.93 folds purification and 53.5 U/mg specific activity. The molecular weight of purified phytase was determined as 53 kDa whereas, Kmand Vmaxwere determined as 3.41 mM and 24.6±0.05 U/mL/min, respectively. Thermodynamic studies of the enzyme revealed activation energy (Ea) and enthalpy of activation (ΔH) as 16.84 KJ/mol and 14.32 KJ/mol, respectively. Phytase showed enzyme activity up to 60℃ but at 30ºC and 5.5 pH, the enzyme showed maximum stablitity. The findings of the current study will help in developing an economical process for phytase biosynthesis.

The continuous discharge of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) containing effluents from industries within and around residential areas is worrisome since they do not only affects human beings, but also beneficial microbes, animals andvegetation due to their mobility in aqueous ecosystem, toxicity and non-biodegradability. The aim of this study is to compare the ability of black and white feathers to adsorb Cd and Pbin two aqueous media and to isolate Cd and Pb tolerant feather-degrading bacteria that will degrade the Cd and Pb polluted feather generated. Black and white chicken feathers were used as bio-adsorbent material in two Cd and Pb containing aqueous solutions (distilled water (DW)and feather meal broth(FMB)). The sorption capacity of the feathers was obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry andgravitational methods. Cd and Pb tolerant bacterium identifiedBacillussp. was isolated from the manure of local chick and used to degrade Cd and Pb polluted feathers. Result shows that black feathers possessed higher uptake capacity of Cd and Pb in FMB and DW, suggesting the high bio-absorption capacity of feathers in FMB that than in DW. A Cd and Pb resistant feather-degrading bacteria isolated from chicken manure were able to degrade about 40% Cd polluted feathers and 30% Pb polluted white feathers in 7 days. Even though the bacterium grew faster in FMB containing Cd polluted feathers, the degradation of Cd polluted white feathers was faster than black. Hydrolysates produced after complete degradation of polluted feathers contained low concentration of heavy metals. Bioremediation of heavy metals and recalcitrant chicken feather wastes can be achieved by melanised and un-melanised feathers and metal resistant feather-degrading bacteria.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1551/938

The materials were characterized by known techniques. The degradation study of PLLGA was made in saline solution and followed by molecular weight change and mass loss percentage. The results showed that PLLGA degradation followed a first order kinetic. Prednisone (immunosuppressive drug) was incorporated into polymeric matrix. The release process was quantified by drug concentration change in the saline solution using UV spectroscopy at 240nm. In this way, diffusion coefficients of prednisone into copolymers were calculated. The results showed that prednisone released was governed by two phenomena: diffusion and degradation. The drug released kinetic was adjusted at two models proposed for biodegradable systems: the model of Higuchi and the model of Charlier. Drug diffusion coefficients were higher in the copolymers with higher percentage of glycolic acid, and they were increasing as the degradation process was progressing.

Saturated solutions, between 293.15 K and 313.15 K, were prepared and cooled following linear profiles in the range of 5 to 15 K/h. Measurements online of temperature, density and crystal size distribution were registered every 30 seconds. In addition, an algorithm was developed in Matlab to solve the mathematical model of the crystallization process. The model included the population and mass balances and power-law equations for nucleation and growth. The algorithm allowed optimizing the kinetic parameters by minimizing the sum of the square of the difference between the experimental and calculated profiles for the concentration of ASA in solution. The results showed that increasing the cooling rate increased the growth rates but decreased the nucleation rates. Besides, the average value ofgsupported that diffusional effects dominate crystal growth and the value ofbsuggested that secondary nucleation promoted the creation of new nuclei. The global error in the estimation of the kinetic parameters was less than 3%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1574/995

In this study, commercial bleached hemp (CBH) fibers were modified using low-pressure rotatory plasma (LPRP) and atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) devices to be further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy―attenuated total reflectance mode (FTIR-ATR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FTIR analysis evidenced the oxidation and crosslinking of cellulose chains. XRD analysis revealed a slight increase in interplanar distances of cellulose chains, that was attributed to the interchain insertion of functional groups. SEM images displayed much rougher surfaces for the treated CBH fibers than for the untreated one. TGA showed that LPRP (30 min treatment) and APPJ increased the thermal resistance of CBH fibers in 30 and 61 °C, respectively. For LPRP, a longer exposition time (180 min) provoked significant eroding without improving the thermal resistance. Finally, the cold plasma surface modification of bleached hemp fibers may well assist with the mechanical interlocking and thermal resistance (during processing) when applied in polymer reinforcing.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1510/893

The specimens were exposed to a brine environment using the impressed current technique during 0, 8, 16, 32 and 64 h, in order to accelerate the corrosion. Behaviour of the corrosion process was evaluated by means of electrochemical measurements using the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy technique (EIS). The results showed an impedance reduction in concrete after impressed current exposure in all tested formulations. Lower reaction rates were observed in specimens with 0 and 15 wt% of SCBA content after 64 hours of accelerated corrosion. The impedance spectra of the samples with 45 wt% of SCBA content were compared with an equivalent circuit model, where high corrosion damage was observed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1651/940

These vectors were first characterized through determination of particle size distribution, surface roughness, specific surface area, density, void fraction and thermal stability. Oxygen transfer was then determined with a non-coalescing medium using polymer volume fractions from 0 to 75% in a 4 L bubble column operated at air flow rates ranging from 1 to 6 L/min. The results showed that the oxygen transfer was significantly improved in presence of 10 and 25% of Kraton and Elvax, compared with control experiment with no polymer. A maximum oxygen transfer improvement of 90%, compared with control, was observed with 10% Kraton. With Desmopan, no positive effect on oxygen transfer was observed regardless of the vector percentage used. Phase’s dispersion and oxygen transfer was further explored in presence of 10% Kraton. Gas holdup, Sauter mean bubble diameter and vector dispersion were characterized by means of high speed digital image analysis. The results showed that the enhancement of oxygen transfer mediated by Kraton was mainly caused by an increase of gas holdup and consequently of the gas/liquid surface area.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1486/896
