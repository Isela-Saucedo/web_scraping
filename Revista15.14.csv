Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Petrographic, geochemical and mineralogical study of the San José de Lourdes fulgurite, Zacatecas, Mexico","Petrographic, chemical and mineralogical studies were performed on a fulgurite formed by melting of soil by lightning strike located at San José de Lourdes, northeast of Fresnillo, State of Zacatecas, Mexico. Polarizing microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with EDS, micro- probe WDS analyses, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence were used as analytical methods. Most of the specimensare tubular and have a smooth, lustrous, black, glassy texture while the exterior is encrusted with soil grains. Internally, this fulgurite is partly composed of heterogeneous vesicular glass mostly of andesitic composi- tion containing fragments of skeletal crystals of wollastonite and unde- termined Fe- silicate, spheroids of SiO2 similar to ballen quartz within the glass. The presence of very fine and scarce grains of ilmenite, zircon, apatite, silver and gold besides some Si-Fe alloys (silicides) of variable composition and arsenic-calcium compounds (which is found for the first time in fulgurites) is also reported. We estimate that the temperatures of crystallization were above 1,700 °C considering into account the melting of quartz and presence of reduced phases.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/477/440

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Lanthanide geochemistry of the fluorite deposits in the Taxco and Zacualpan mining districts, southern Mexico: implications for the origin and evolution of fluids","We present and evaluate lanthanide contents measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in fluorite samples from the fluorite deposits in Zacualpan and Taxco mining districts in the south of Mexico. The information is used to distinguish different generations of fluorite, to establish a correlation between mineralization episodes and the wall rock nature, and to identify postdepositional processes.The total lanthanide content of the fluorites are variable, and early- stage fluorite samples are usually enriched in LREE. The concentration of REE in fluorite is low in comparison with the volcanic and metamorphic rocks (∑REE > 100 ppm) and is generally high respect the carbonates (∑REE < 30 ppm). There is host rock influence. The higher REE concentra- tions are in fluorites hosted by volcanic rocks. The fluorite that replaced carbonate is characterized by low REE to very low concentrations. Fluorite samples associated with sulfurs are typically enriched in HREE. Nearly all fluorites show a negative Eu anomaly similar to the REE anomaly observed in the volcanic rock. Only some early stage dark, uranium rich fluorites, from la Azul deposit, have a strong positive Eu anomaly. Direct correlation between color and REE patterns is observed in some samples.In the Zacualpan mining district, only an episode of mineralization has been discriminated, where fluorite presents flat to HREE- enriched chondrite-normalized REE patterns.In the Taxco mining district and particularly in the “Mina la Azul”, multiple hydrothermal events of mineralization have been determined. The first generation of fluorite is formed by replacement of carbonates and is characterized by very low contents of lanthanides, chondrite- normalized REE patterns similar to the limestone, high strontium content and primary textures (e.g. massive fluorite and rhythmites). The second generation of fluorite is related to the entry of new fluid to the system and has higher REE concentrations, chondrite-normalized REE patterns similar to volcanic rocks, low strontium content and secondary textures (i.e. breccias, nodules). Most of the samples show a genetic relationship between fluorite and fluids of magmatic origin.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/455/438

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geoquímica y mineralogía de los jales del distrito minero Tlalpujahua-El Oro, México, y sus implicaciones de impacto ambiental","The tailing dumps of the mining district of Tlalpujahua and El Oro (DIMITO) were stacked on the active drainage system and covering a basement consisting of carbonaceous limestones and shales ± andesites, which constitute the host rock of the epithermal Au vein-type deposit. This geomorphological setting shows deep channels and gullies of erosion and it has been estimated a loss of material > 27–34% of its original volume. We present mapping of five tailing dumps that were placed ~68 year ago as well as the mineralogical and geochemical characterization of 12 profiles and 48 samples. Tailings are essentially siliceous-calcareous slime with clasts. Their pH is slightly alkaline from 7.5 to 8.5 and they show low conductivity <80 µS/cm. They are constituted by abundant quartz (≥ 53–68 %), lithics (7-20 %), calcite (≥12 %), silicates (9–11 %), Fe-Ti oxides (≥2–3 %) and sulphides and sulphosalts (≤2 %). Bulk composi- tions are characterized by SiO2 (56–92 %), Al2O3 (>15–13 %), CaO+MgO (≥5–11 %), Fetot (≤3–5 %), S (0.3–0.91 %), and C (3.4 –6.1 %). DIMITO tailings show values of Au (1.2–1.61 g/ton), Ag (28.1–46.8 g/ton), Pb (53.3–145.2 g/ton) and Zn (155.9–354.5 g/ton), suggesting that they could still have some economic recovering. In relation to the concentrations of the potentially toxic elements, the values of Sb (27.3–72.2 g/ton) signifi- cantly exceed high risk of the LMP (WHO, 2015), and a dozen samples of Pb and Zn and As (25.2–40.5 g/ton) show higher values than low-risk of the LMP. However, these values are scattered and random in each profile, so its toxic potential is discussed based on its mineralogical-geochemical correlation and its potential mobility. In order to estimate the acid-base accounting (ABA) of the DIMITO, we carried out a mathematical model based from the Gauss-reduction normalization of the geochemical data and their relationships with normative mineralogy. We found that the mineralogy represents a powerful proxy for the diagnostic of the toxic potential of the waste mines and that in general the tailings show not risk of acide mine drainage generation. However, we discuss the environment impact of the tailing dumps and the relationships with the actual land use of the DIMITO.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/540/439
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Bosque de Tlalpan pumice, product of a large-magnitude eruption at the southwestern margin of the Mexico basin","In this contribution we describe a white pumice fall deposit, informally named pómez Bosque de Tlalpan (PBT), found in several outcrops in the southern Mexico basin. The most representative sequence occurs at the Bosque de Tlalpan park, Delegación Tlalpan, in Mexico City. In this site the deposit is 3 m thick, massive, and contains 80–90 vol. % of pumice clasts, predominantly of coarse lapilli-sized and some block-sized fragments. The PBT has a dacitic composition (64.9–66 wt. % SiO2, on anhydrous basis) of calc-alkaline affinity, and a mineral assemblage represented by plagioclase > amphibole > orthopyroxene > biotite, ±Fe-Ti oxides, with quartz in lesser proportions, and zircon as accesory mineral, in a vesicular and glassy matrix. According to data collected from seven outcrops, thickness and clast size of the deposit decrease towards the NE and therefore the vent source should be located to the SW of Bosque de Tlalpan. Possible sources are the volcanoes Ajusco and San Miguel, which are part of the Sierra de Las Cruces volcanic range, and are located in this direction at ~11 km from Bosque de Tlalpan. The age of the PBT deposit was determined by radiocarbon dating of underlying paleosoils that yielded 25,730 ± 130 to 37,450 ± 330 yrs B.P. (Late Pleistocene). Additionally, thermoluminscence dating of one sample yielded an age of 30,300 ± 5,000 years, similar to the radiocarbon ages. Hence, the PBT represents the youngest reported deposit from the Sierra de Las Cruces volcanic range. Although only seven outcrops were described in this work, we interpret the PBT deposit as produced by a plinian-type eruption, based on its massive structure, its ca. 3 m thickness, and the presence of pumice clasts in coarse lapilli to block sizes, as well as 3.5 cm sized lithics, at 11 km from the possible vent source, characteristic of this kind of deposits. We discard the monogenetic volcanoes from the Chichinautzin volcanic field as the vent source of the PBT deposit, because this kind of volcanoes is relatively mafic in composition and do not produce plinian-type deposits.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/485/441
