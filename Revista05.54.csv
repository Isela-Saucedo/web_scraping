AND DRY BIOMASS RECOVERY,"Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that are studied due to the variety of metabolites that they produce. However, if cultivated in photobioreactors, these devices should be easy to scale up. Also, harvesting and drying the microalgal biomass should be economically viable at industrial scales. Based on this point of view, in this work a 1.5 L cylindrical-conical photobioreactor was designed to cultivate and harvest the microalgaCoelastrumsp. under nitrogen limitation. Maximum cell density was 23.47 × 106cells mL-1. Biomass and lipid productivities after 5 days of nitrogen limitation were 266.24 mg L-1d-1and 137.51 mg L-1d-1respectively. A lipid content of 45.6% (w/w dry biomass) was attained. A sludge drying bed was also designed to dry the microalgal biomass. The retention filter used in the sludge drying bed allowed a cell retention efficiency of 86.8% and the final water content of the dried biomass was 7.82 % ± 1.99 which allowed the lipid extraction without further drying. The lipid profile after transesterification of triacylglycerides was [C14:0 (3.04%), C16:0 (35.52%), C18:0 (42.50%), C18:1 (14.30%), C18:2 (4.63%)] which indicates that the lipid extract is more suitable for green diesel than biodiesel production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/67/92

The yield of chitin was 11.6% and 6.2% forT.molitorandG.mellonella, respectively. The degree of deacetylation of chitosan was 80.5% and 88.5% forG.mellonellaandT.molitor, respectively. The content of nitrogen (≈ 6.5%), humidity (≈ 5.8%) and ashes (≈ 0.4%) in the chitin and chitosan of both insects indicated an acceptable quality. No differences were observed between the molecular weights of the chitin (≈ 889 kDa) and the chitosan (≈ 254 kDa) of both insects. Scanning electron microscopy revealed fiber structures in the chitin and chitosan fromT.molitor; in contrast, the chitin and chitosan ofG.mellonellawere spongy. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed α-type polymorphism in the chitin of both insects. The biopolymers ofG.mellonellaexhibited a higher crystallinity index than those ofT.molitor. Due to the higher yield obtained fromT.molitor, this insect could be considered as a promising alternative source for obtaining chitin and chitosan.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/85/95

Even though the biotechnological production is the leading approach, medium cost is a serious bottleneck. Starch from agroindustrial residues, such as avocado seeds, stands out as a promising feedstock. A Plackett-Burman design was used for screening and selection of MRS medium components that could be substituted with avocado seed hydrolysate (ASH) for growth and lactic acid production byLactobacillussp. The screening was performed using 20 g/L initial reducing sugars from the ASH; then, the effect of an increasing carbon-source concentration was evaluated. Five out of nine components could be substituted from the MRS medium for lactic acid production; this represented a medium cost reduction of at least 17 %. Peptone from casein (10 g/L), meat extract (8 g/L), yeast extract (4 g/L), and sodium acetate (5 g/L) had to be maintained. The highest lactic acid concentration was estimated at 5.7 ± 0.7 g/L, achieved at 40.0 ± 2.0 g/L initial reducing sugar in experiments carried out in a stirred tank bioreactor, despite the presence of some inhibitory growth effects. Kinetic parameters were also obtained. This study may serve as a starting point for further research since this is the first study reported in the literature exploring the production of lactic acid from ASH as a feedstock.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/108/104

Gompertz model was chosen as the best fit for the profiles of growth and hydrocarbon consumption. The microbial biomass achieved removal efficiencies of 70 ± 2 % and a high maximum growth rate (μmax= 0.76 d-1). Hydrocarbon degradation increased due to solubilization strategies, mainly emulsification. In particular, a maximum emulsification index (17.7 ± 0.4 %) was reached at 12-day of cultivation increasing the solubility and dispersion of hydrocarbons. Our work contributes to understand the mechanisms of hydrocarbon-degradation in multiphasic systems and reveal the potential use of this native-microbial biomass for bioremediation purposes.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/144/106

The objective of this paper is to characterize and immobilize carboxymethylcellulase enzymes produced by solid-state fermentation of the processing food wastes of acerola (Malpighia glabra), guava (Psidium guajava), cassava (Manihot esculenta), and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) using the Aspergillus niger. Enzyme activities were determined at different temperatures (40-90°C) and pHs (4.0-8.0). The enzymes were immobilized by adsorption onto silica gel and celite 545 supports. One could observe that the optimal carboxymethylcellulases temperatures of the crude enzymatic extracts from A. niger using acerola, guava, cassava and passion fruit residues ranged from 40-60°C and that the optimal pHs varied between 5.0-6.0. One it was found that the carboxymethylcellulases in these extracts presented high immobilization yields (85%, 93%, 46%, 34%) on silica gel and (91%, 87% 129%, 38%) celite, respectively.

Microalgae culture are carried out on photobioreactors, which are often very complex. Therefore, the automatic control of these devices can be very difficult and the lack of in-line sensors makes it difficult to control them. For this purpose, state observers have proven to be an excellent tool for measuring variables that cannot be measured online. In this work, we propose the theoretical design of a robust linear type observer, the so-called Chained Observer. Stability is demonstrated through Lyapunov functions and an observer is didactically designed for the study of tertiary wastewater treatment by demonstrating that under certain conditions, the Chained Observer presents better yields than even more sophisticated observers.

The results indicated that the suggested models were significantly (p≤0.05) fitted for all response variables (emulsion droplet size, ζ-potential, Turbiscan stability index and apparent viscosity) and showed high coefficients of determinations (0.897 - 0.933). The soy protein isolate had the major effect on the evaluated parameters due to their emulsifying property and electrical charge. The microfluidization technology allowed the production of emulsions with a droplet size in the range of nanometers (<500 nm) and monomodal particle size distribution. The optimum condition to obtain the minimum emulsion droplet size (300.97 nm), ζ-potential (-40.03 mV), Turbiscan stability index (1.06) and apparent viscosity (18.65 mPa•s) was when a chia oil emulsion was formulated with 4.8 % w/w of SPI and 25.2 % w/w of MD, applying high microfluidization pressure (104 MPa).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/102/97

In the present work, it was evaluated the influence of two fluid nozzles of different dimensions on stability parameters of oil in water emulsion produced by microfluidization and using gum Arabic as wall material. Results indicated that the droplet size, the polydispersity index and the Turbiscan stability index of atomized emulsions were affected by and Oswald ripening mechanism as compared with those of the original emulsion. The confocal laser scanning microscopy images confirmed that the passage of the emulsion through the atomization devices decreased the thickness of wall material of the droplets with respect to the original emulsion. It was concluded that, in the proper design of the final products prepared by atomization it must be considered its effect on the stability of the atomized emulsions by including during the processing, a suitable sampling-characterization on-line scheme.","J.C.

Its mesocarp is processed into jellies, sauces and other products but the endocarp is discarded as waste. This endocarp contains appreciable amounts of bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of microwave pretreatment on phenolic compounds and flavonoid extraction from xoconostle endocarp and to determine their antioxidant capacity and microstructure changes. According to the surface response methodology, the optimal conditions for phenolic compounds and flavonoid extractions from endocarp using microwave pre-treatment (297 W for 5.5 min) were: 0% ethanol, 5 °C and 10 min of stirring. The total phenolic, total flavonoid, betalains and ascorbic acid contents, and the antioxidant capacity were higher in the microwave pretreated samples compared with non-pretreated microwave samples. The following phenolic acids and flavonoids were identified in the endocarp extracts obtained under optimal conditions:  gallic, caffeic, protocatechuic, coumaric and, vanillic acids, epicatechin and catechin. Our results suggest that the application of a microwave pretreatment improves compounds extraction present in xoconostle endocarp, which could be an alternative source of bioactive substances with high antioxidant capacity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/147/107

Experimental infant formula (EF) was designed to closely resemble the protein composition of human milk. Response surface method (RSM) with two factors: total solids and inlet air temperature was used for the optimization of the spray drying process. Response variables were solubility, moisture content, luminance and peroxide value. To define optimal drying conditions, a stability test was performed for two treatments (120 °C, 40 wt. % and 170 °C, 30 wt. %), which were obtained from the RSM. The treatment with 170 °C and 30 wt. % concentration of total solids was selected as the best alternative for the spray drying process. The protein composition in the EF was 37.1% casein, 23.1% α-lactalbumin and 21.3% β-lactoglobulin. A decrease of 6 % in β-lactoglobulin increased the relative proportion of α-lactalbumin, which favoured the similarity of the EF to breast milk.

This fruit is used for human consumption as well as feedstuff for ovines, caprines, and other farm animals. Other researchers previously observed changes in hormonal profiles on rats fed with mesquite pod extracts, affecting their reproductive cycle and behavior; those changes were attributed to phytoestrogens such as genistein and daidzein reported in soybeans, possibly present in mesquite due that this plant is also a legume.

Considering that the inadequate disposal of this water causes environmental contamination, this work aimed to investigate the adsorption of emulsified oil present in the produced water, using sugarcane bagasse (an abundant by-product from sugar/ethanol production) as adsorbent, improving the treatment of this type of effluent. The adsorption reached equilibrium within 5 minutes of contact and more than 90% of the emulsified oil present in the mixture was removed when 0.1% adsorbent (m/v) was used at 30 °C and 110 rpm. Pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order models were applied to adjust the kinetic data. The best correlation was provided by the pseudo first-order kinetic model demonstrating that chemical sorption was the rate-limiting step, although intraparticle diffusion can not be neglected. From these results, it can be stated that the use of sugarcane residues as an adsorbent agent is an alternative for the efficient removal of the oil present in the produced water.

One of the important factors of the nitrification in trickling filters is that, contrary to what happens with activated sludge where the hydraulic retention time is 4 to 8 hours, in trickling filters it is 5 to 15 minutes, so there is more possibilities to achieve nitrification in activated sludge that in trickling filters. The objective of this work was to evaluate the behavior of the nitrification process of the trickling filters of the Wastewater Treatment Plant ""El Punto"" located in Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico. The laboratory results indicated low nitrogen removal not complying with the maximum permissible limits for discharge to a river; also analyzed some parameters that influence the nitrification kinetics such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and alkalinity.

Some turbine blades are made of materials like stainless steel AISI-410. In this paper the effect of temperature on corrosion crack propagation produced in a stainless steel AISI-410 type was studied. The cracked specimens were exposed in seawater during 5 days at two temperatures (25 °C and 90 °C) in static conditions. The corrosion was studied using the electrochemical noise technique (EN) and potentiodynamic polarization curves (PC). The electrochemical noise time series were used to analyze the changes in corrosion activity for AISI-410 under the mentioned experimental conditions determining the type and corrosion rate. The results showed that cracks were grown when exposed in seawater, especially at the higher temperature. Physical characterization obtained from SEM showed a great amount of corrosion products emerging from the cracks, observing a mixed corrosion type around the cracks: uniform and pitting. From the results, it is deduced that this corrosion attack may influence crevice corrosion, which eventually leads to stress corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue.","C.M.

One disadvantage is their insolubility in different media which limits their performance and processing. By employing techniques not covalent with surfactants is possible increase dispersion of CNT. This article reports the results found in the detection of ozone using pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in three different media: deionized water, methanol and glycerol. Materials dispersed in deionized water exhibited a zero detection of ozone at different concentrations studied. In comparison, electronic devices where sensitive materials were dispersed with methanol and glycerol showed a change in resistance depending on concentration and operating temperature evaluated. The best response was found to be at high temperatures (120 -200 °C). The materials have been characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and optical microscopy technique",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/128/102

ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol-gel method and their functionalization was made by the hydrolytic silanization method. Their mechanical properties were evaluated using a Langmuir trough equipped with a Du Noüy-Padday rod. With this technique, isotherms, compression modules and hysteresis cycles of the system were obtained. Our results showed that partially hydrophobic particles form two dimensional soft solids at the air/water interface, reaching values of their adiabatic compression modulus corresponding to a liquid condensed phase when they are compressed above surface concentrations of the order of 1x101mg/m2. Nanoparticle layers presented dependence with the rate of compression and significant hysteresis, showing their complex behavior. Layers did not present collapse, but a semi constant value of the pressure upon high surface concentrations was observed, an indicative of the high adsorption energy of the nanoparticles. The mechanical properties reported, make these particles suitable for further applications on the stabilization of aqueous foams.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/145/108

Hammet titration results showed that the isomorphic substitution of Mg by Al atoms induces a basicity character decrease. Theoretical DFT studies of MgAl-x oxides basicity through the oxygen Milliken charges showed a similar trend to that observed experimentally. The effect in the textural properties as a function of the Al content was observed reflected directly in the surface area and pore size distributions.

However, after several burn cycles at temperatures of up to 1000 °C, these kilns may expand, crack and open. In light of that, we worked to obtain a refractory geopolymer that attaches to red brick to use as an internal kiln coating to increase the useful life of the kiln. We studied the consolidation from refractory clays and a solution of commercial sodium silicate ( =1.38, SiO2/Na2O ratio =3.09). This process originates the synthesis of a geopolymer. The clays were previously selected for their refractory characteristics from different clay banks in the municipality of Comonfort, Guanajuato, México; they have been identified as Caolín, Tepozán, and Bauwer. The clays were subjected to a process of grinding and sieving to a particle size of 60 Tyler mesh . Next, they were characterized using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which determined that they contained high percentages of SiO2and Al2O3. The mineralogy of the raw clays was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), yielding high percentages of kaolinite, alunite, quartz and smectite. This composition validates the refractory potential of clays. A simplex-centroid design was used to formulate the geopolymer. The response surface methodology was used for optimization, keeping the commercial sodium silicate concentration constant. The adherence of the formulated geopolymer on red clay brick was taken as a response variable, yielding 50% for the consolidating material (commercial sodium silicate), 21% for Caolín, 23% for Tepozán, and 6% for Bauwer, where the curing time was 7 days and the burning cycle was 8 hours at 1000 °C. This property was measured in a universal testing machine. The best fit was a quadratic model with synergistic interactions between all factors, and the mean adherence of 28.11 kgf/cm2(2.8 MPa) was obtained.  Common potential applications of geopolymer coatings include protection against salt corrosion of marine concrete, reinforced concrete manufacturing, concrete infrastructure rehabilitation, fire inhibition, resistance to temperature and corrosion and as heat insulators. Geopolymers may also have promising use in construction due to their similar strength and durability properties as conventional concrete. The red brick joined to the obtained geopolymer can be used as an internal coating in fixed brick kilns to increase its useful life. In addition, it has potential use for bonding materials that may be exposed to temperatures below 1000 °C or for replacing concrete in ovens exposed to high temperatures.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/349/122

The films were analyzed for thickness, transparency, solubility, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The transparency was increased as the PCL concentration increased and there was no difference in solubility for any of the formulations evaluated. On the other hand, FTIR spectra revealed an increase in hydroxyl groups, amides and carbonyls bands as the concentration of PCL andM.oleiferaextract increased. XRD diffractograms showed a good miscibility between chitosan and PCL using concentrated acetic acid as the solvent. The properties of PCL to modify the physico-structural characteristics of chitosan are maintained.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/111/99

The as-obtained materials were characterized structurally, chemically, thermally and morphologically by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties of the extruded blends were characterized by the tensile and impact test, whilst the degradation process was studied by environmental composting and accelerated weathering. Independently of the PLA amount, the samples showed coarse droplet morphology; however, it causes an important crystallinity reduction. Slight changes in the mechanical and thermal properties were also observed. The best performance was achieved with the 85/15 molar ratio, which showed a lifetime decrease close to 60 % in comparison with HDPE.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/156/113

Jackfruit seeds are a source of various lectins, with several isoforms and isoelectric points. Therefore, ion exchange can be a viable alternative for lectin separation. In this work we developed a single-step purification protocol for lectins from jackfruit seed extract in ion exchange cryogels. Supermacroporous cryogels were functionalized with cationic and anionic exchangers. The matrices produced showed high swelling capacity (12.4 and 14.7 kg kg-1), expansion degree (12.70 to 18.0 L kg-1), and total porosity around 90%. The performance of the ion exchanger cryogels in lectin purification were evaluated. A single elution peak was obtained in all assays. The purification factor (PF) was determined based on the agglutination of human blood ABO types, with a PF of 3.57 in the best condition, using the cryogel functionalized with 2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and blood type B agglutination, suggesting the jacalin purification. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis confirmed that the eluted samples showed two strong bands around 13.5 kDa and 16 kDa. The results demonstrate that ion-exchange monolithic cryogels showed potential use for the purification of lectins from jackfruit seeds in a rapid and single-step protocol.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/172/118
