Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Weathering and tectonic settings of the siliciclastic rocks from the Morita Formation, northeastern Sonora, Mexico","Geochemistry of major oxides was carried out on the siliciclastic rocks collected from the Sierra Anibacachi and Rancho Búfalo sections of the Morita Formation (Early Cretaceous) exposed in the northeast of Sonora, to interpret the paleoweathering conditions and tectonic settings of the source rocks. Geochemically, the siliciclastic rocks were classified as sub-litharenite, litharenite, subarkose and Fe-sand. The Morita Formation consists mainly of siliciclastic rocks that were deposited under fluvial conditions and the total thickness vary between 560 and 855 m in Sierra Anibacahi and Rancho Búfalo, respectively. The CIA and PIA values and A-CN-K diagram of sandstones from Sierra Anibacachi section indicate a low to intense chemical weathering of the source area, whereas CIA values for siltstone and shale show moderate intensity of chemical weathering in the source region. Similarly, the CIA and PIA values and the A-CN-K plot suggest that the sandstones from Rancho Búfalo section were derived from low to intensely weathered source region, whereas siltstones were received sediments from source rocks affected by low to moderate degree of chemical weathering. The siliciclastic rocks from Sierra Anibacachi and Rancho Búfalo sections show large variations in ICV values, indicating that these samples are compositionally immature to mature. The tectonic discriminant-function-based multidimensional diagram shows arc, rift and collision fields for the sandstones from Sierra Anibacachi section, rift and collision for siltstone, while collision setting for shales. However, most of the sandstones and siltstones from Rancho Búfalo section fall in the arc field, whereas some sandstones fall in the collision field. The siliciclastic rocks from Sierra Anibacachi and Rancho Búfalo section show large variations in the tectonic settings of the source rocks. However, the results obtained from the discriminant function diagrams are consistent with a regional tectonic evolution of the study area.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/481/845

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Chemical and isotopic signatures of hot springs from east-central Sonora State, Mexico: a new prospection survey of promissory low-to-medium temperature geothermal systems","A promissory low-to-medium temperature geothermal system located in Sonora (Mexico) has been studied. In the present work, a detailed geochemical survey was carried out to understand the hydrogeochemical signatures of hot spring waters. A field work campaign was conducted for collecting water samples from twelve hot springs placed in four major zones (NW, NE, C, and S). The collected samples were analysed by chemical and isotopic methods for determining their chemical (major and trace elements) and isotopic (18O/16O and D/H) compositions. Using geochemometric analyses of the fluid composition and fractionation, depletion and enrichment processes exhibited by major and trace elements were analysed.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/397/846

Contributing to fill this gap, we present a first approach to discriminate and characterize the depositional systems of the late Eocene Yolomécatl Formation, which fills the namesake, triangle-shaped tectonic basin, and carries the southernmost Paleogene vertebrate fauna of North America. The study area lies between 17°25’–17°30’ North Latitude and 97°29’–97°36’ West Longitude, and between 2000–2500 m a.s.l.; the federal highway 125 traverses it; Santiago Yolomécatl is the main town.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/559/847
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"A multi-elemental study to establish the natural background and geochemical anomalies in rocks from the Sonora river upper basin, NW Mexico","Growing industrialization, including mining activity, dramatically increases environmental pollution. Exploitation of natural resources triggers landscape alteration, inputs of potentially toxic chemical elements to the environment and health diseases. In the case of mining activity, the measure of any associated environmental disturbance requires a geochemical background as a reference frame. Since in Mexico, there is a lack of this type of references in mining districts, the present study took a recent mining spill as an opportunity to establish the geochemical background of the upper Sonora river basin, which includes active and historical mining areas. The weighted average of elemental values was calculated using GIS tools. The data show that rocks have a similar geochemical behavior, which is characterized by pristine enrichment of Mn, Ca, P, Ba, Zn, As, Ag, Sb, W, Pb and Bi relative to the upper continental crust. Coefficients of variation values reveal that Sc, Y, Zr, Ce, Yb, Fe, Ti and Al display a conservative behavior and, therefore, they are recommended to be used as reference elements in environmental studies in the basin. The findings of this work highlight the need of determining the geochemical background in mining regions to reach more realistic environmental assessments.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/605/849

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Environmental conditions at the end of the Isotopic Stage 6 (EI 6:> 130000 years) in the center of Mexico: characterization of a section of laminated sediments from Lago de Chalco,"Annually laminated sediments (varves) frequently form in lakes with contrasting seasonal environments, and are better preserved in deep water bodies, with low oxygen content at the water/sediment interface. We characterized deposits in a laminated section within the sedimentary record from Lake Chalco, Basin of Mexico. The laminated sediments are intercalated with massive sediments, volcaniclastic material and 13 micritic mud layers. This laminated sequence corresponds to the depth interval 122.5 to 106 m and has an age >130 ka, 4 corresponding with the end of the penultimate glacial stage or Marine Isotopic Stage 6 (MIS 6). Dark and light lamina, as well as the micritic mud components, were identified by microscopic observation of sediment smear slides; some sediment in the dark laminae, light laminae and micritic mud layers was also analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. X-ray fluorescence was used to determine Ti content and Si/Ti and Ca/Ti ratios. These analyses enabled us to determine that the light laminae have high Si/Ti values, are formed mostly by diatom valves (Stephanodiscus niagaraeandS. oregonicus), and represent a biogenic diatom ooze. Dark laminae have high Ti values and are formed mainly by clastic sediments including plagioclases and amphiboles. We propose an annual depositional model in which light laminae correspond to winter diatom blooms, whereas dark laminae were deposited by allochthonous inwash during the summer rainy season, thus forming a biogenic-clastic varve. Diatom ecology suggests the laminated sequence corresponds to a relatively deep, eutrophic to hypertrophic lake with cool to cold waters. This inference is consistent with the age of the deposits, which corresponds with the penultimate glacial maximum or MIS 6, for which we infer cooler and moistier conditions than for the last glacial maximum i.e. MIS 2. Sedimentation rates estimated by varve counts suggest that the laminated sequence was deposited during a ~5,000 yr interval. The micritic mud layers have high Ca/Ti and Si/Ti ratios and are formed mainly by authigenic carbonates, sponge spicules, diatoms and ostracode valves. We propose that these chemical facies were deposited during periods of higher evaporation and water concentration and also lower lake level and high biological productivity. The recurrence of these events must be further studied, but based on the mean sedimentation rate of 2.9 mm/yr, calculated from varve counting we suggest that they have a 140-yr to 289-yr recurrence interval.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/649/850
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"On the occurrence of Vinctifer ferrusquiai sp. nov. (Actinopterygii, Aspidorhynchiformes) in the Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic) deposits near Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, southern Mexico","Vinctifer ferrusquiaisp. nov. is described in this paper. This aspidorhynchid fish was found in Kimmeridgian marine deposits of the Sabinal Formation, exposed in the Llano Yosobé, near Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, Mexico. The single specimen of this species shows enough diagnostic characters to be included in the order Aspidorhynchiformes, the family Aspidorhynchidae, and the genusVinctifer. These characters include an elongate rostrum consisting of the premaxillae fused and anteriorly elongated, forming a tube-like, as well as an preopercular sensory canal located close to the posterior edge of the preopercle. Other features are the lack of premaxilla, the development of a wide posterior expansion of the maxilla, and a stout triangular preopercle. A unique combination of characters supports the erection of this new species, whose ganoine on dermal bones of the head are strongly ornamented with tubercles and ridges, and the flank scales are entirely smooth and not serrated. This Jurassic record is the first indubitable pre-Cretaceous finding ofVinctifer,the oldest into the Hispanic Corridor, and the oldest in North America.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/713/852
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Geochemistry of siliciclastic rocks from the Corral de Enmedio Formation and Camas Sandstone, Cabullona basin, Sonora: paleoweathering and provenance","The sedimentary sequence of the Cabullona Group deposited in the Cabullona basin during Late Cretaceous is well exposed in the Naco region of northeastern Sonora. It has been divided into various formations and the total thickness of this group is about 2.5 km with possible age of 72 Ma. Geochemical study was undertaken on the sandstones of the Corral de Enmedio Formation and the Camas Sandstone to determine the paleoweathering, provenance and tectonic setting. The ΣREE contents range from 96 to 144 ppm for the sandstones from Corral de Enmedio Formation and 74 to 169 ppm for the Camas Sandstone. The chondrite normalized REE diagrams for sandstones from both formations have LREE enriched, relatively flat HREE patterns with negative to positive Eu anomalies. The CIA and PIA values and A–CN–K diagram indicate that the sandstones of the Corral de Enmedio Formation were derived from the source area that was subjected to a low degree of chemical weathering, whereas the Camas Sandstone reveals low to moderate intensity of chemical weathering of the source area. Al2O3/TiO2ratios, and various bivariate and ternary diagrams, comparison of REE patterns with source rocks, and mixing calculation of source rocks indicate that the sandstones of the Corral de Enmedio Formation were predominantly derived from felsic source rocks, with minor contribution from intermediate rocks, whereas the Camas Sandstone received sediments mainly from felsic source rocks.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/550/853
