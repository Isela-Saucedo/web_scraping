Cultivation of fungi is necessary for their genetic, biochemical, and morphological characterization. Due to their great metabolic capacity, fungi can grow on poorly processed raw materials. That quality has been taken advantage of to formulate inexpensive growth media such as those based on potato. Here, we test the suitability of a growth media consisting of hydrolysates of avocado seeds (ASM), which are by-products of avocado agroindustry, to cultivate six different fungal isolates coming from strawberry plants. We compared the performance of this medium versus PDA and V8, two well-known media among mycologists. We show that ASM is a competitive and suitable medium for fungal growth.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1951/1200

The yeastPichia fermentansITD-00165 has demonstrated a high potential to produce isoamyl acetate. The yeast was cultured in a bioreactor on a chemically defined medium to evaluate the influence of airflow (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 vvm) and agitation speed (150, 175, and 200 rpm) on the isoamyl acetate production. Isoamyl acetate was retained using anin situentrapping system, which was obtained, adding a cap of n-decane in a ratio of 80:20 (medium:decane). This work demonstrated the relevance of well-controlled aeration to enhance isoamyl acetate production using isoamyl alcohol as a precursor. Culture operating near to 0.71 vvm and 168 rpm (kLa= 0.16 min-1) achieved production of 2.14 g L-1, which means an almost 2.5-fold increase in respect to the higher value previously reported. On the other hand, the minimum production occurred at the best aeration conditions (kLa= 0.22 min-1), meaning that excessive aeration could negatively affect the aroma production. Nevertheless, it appears that the concomitant ethanol production negatively affects aroma production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2125/1202

In this work thein vitrosynbiotic activities ofLactobacillus plantarummicrocapsules with Aloe vera mucilage, high degree of polymerization agave fructans and food additives as wall materials were evaluated. The synbiotic behavior was assessed by rheological mucoadhesion, simulation of gastrointestinal digestion, growth inhibition of pathogens, antibiotic activity of extracellular metabolites and viability of the probiotic during storage at room and refrigeration temperatures. Rheological studies demonstrated that the biopolymer mixture interact with intestinal adhesion proteins (mucin) by the formation of weak gels with hydrogen bonds. During the simulated gastrointestinal digestion, the viability of the microorganism released from mixtures with arabic gum increases after two hours, which evidence microorganism release from the capsule. The extracellular metabolites extract (e.g.butyric, lactic and acetic acids) proved to be significantly more effective in the growth inhibition of pathogens and the storage viability reduction is lower than 0.5 log CFU/g after 70 days. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time, that microcapsules of a known probiotic encapsulated with Aloe vera mucilage, agave fructans of high degree of polymerization and arabic gum, do behave as a synbiotic matrix, guaranteeing that the probiotic will produce potential health benefits and could be used in the formulation of functional foods and products.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2234/1211

Nevertheless, one of the main limitations of this bioconversion is the inhibition of yeast growth by 2-PE. This work evaluated the intensification of 2-PE production in a batch culture using a conventional bioreactor coupled to anin-situproduct removal (ISPR) process, by means of membrane-based solvent extraction (MBSE). The culture of the native yeastKluyveromyces marxianusITD0090, using a shaker flask stirred at 150 rpm, produced a maximum concentration of 2-PE of 0.7 g L-1after 24 hours. When the yeast was cultivated in a controlled aerated-stirred bioreactor operated at 0.8 vvm and 350 rpm, the maximum production of 2-PE after 48 h reached 1.49 g L-1. Intensification of the bioprocess was achieved by coupling the controlled bioreactor with a MBSE system, which allowed the continuous recovery of the 2-PE produced, reaching a final titre of 3.02 g L-1after 56 h.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2060/1213

Maximum enzyme activity 15.2 U/ml was produced after 72 h of incubation at 30˚C. The protein was partially purified by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation and immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC) technique. SDS-PAGE analysis showed molecular weight of esterase was 70 kDa. Effects of different nitrogrn and carbon sources with different concentrations were also studied. Partially purified enzyme was active at pH of 6.0 for up to 3 h and at temperature of 70˚C for 1 h. Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+1, and K+1play an important role in increasing enzyme activity. The residual activity of esterase was decreased in the presence of organic solvents. SDS, β-mercaptoethanol, and DMSO are good inhibitors for esterase enzyme. Under these conditions, partially purified esterase with specific activity of 114.20 U/mg and 47.58 purification fold was obtained. The data achieved from this work are important in terms of heat stability and pH of esterase and giving a new enzyme source for industrial applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2034/1216

McKelvey obtained from in vitro cultures,"It has been demonstrated that some species of theYuccagenus are a source of metabolites with functional properties, as isYucca carnerosana(Trel.) McKelvey with antifungal activity. This research aimed to induce the formation of callus tissue inY. carnerosana, to know the growth kinetic, and to analyze the metabolite profile of the formed tissue and plants propagated underin vitroandex vitroconditions. Callus induction was achieved using Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 4.4 µM benzyladenine and 4.1 µM 4-aminotrichloropicolinic acid (Picloram). The growth kinetics of callus tissue was characterized by a latency phase achieved in the second week of culture, followed by an exponential growth until the fourth week. The culture showed a specific growth rate of 0.0258 d-1; the doubling time was 26.866 days, and the growth index was 5.9091. The metabolite profile was analyzed using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-PDA-HESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS). The chromatographic and mass spectral analysis allowed the separation and identification of 22 compounds in callus tissue, 26 inin vitroplants, and 27 inex vitroplants. Our results indicate that the callus tissue and thein vitroandex vitroplants ofY. carnerosanamay be a source of metabolites of interest.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2209/1217

For this purpose, biolixiviation processes were assessed during 21 days at 30°C and 150 rpm, with 1% (w/v) of IW pulp density. Microbial growth was evaluated periodically by measuring sulfates´ production; pH and sulfuric acid concentration were also monitored, and metal bioleaching was evaluated by ICP-OES. Results showed thatA. thiooxidanssulfur-oxidizing activity was higher in the presence of IW-steel. Specifically, sulfates and sulfuric acid production in IW-steel corresponded to 21,524 mg/L and 0.096 M, respectively, with a pH diminution to 1.54. In the case of IW-scrap, sulfates´ production only increased to up to 4392 mg/L at day 21, and not so significant changes were observed in pH and sulfuric acid concentration. Besides, metal removal was higher in IW-steel, being Fe > Mn > Mg ≥ Zn ≥ Cu > Cr ≥ Ni. The results obtained reinforce the fact thatA. thiooxidansDSM 26636 presents an elevated potential to be employed in biotreatment processes, and that its biolixiviation efficiency strongly depends on the metal content present in the residues.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2079/1219

G Don.,"Plant cell culture technology, particularly suspension cultures, appears as a convenient tool to industrially produce molecules such as the anticancer molecules vincristine and vinblastine. Cell differentiation is needed for theirin vivosynthesis and thusin vitrocultures have usually been considered as limited producing platforms. Several studies have recently detected vincristine and vinblastine in early differentiated calluses and also in suspension cultures. Nevertheless, the degree of cell differentiation has not been addressed, particularly in suspension cultures that could be used as a large-scale producing platform. Therefore, the effect of culture conditions on the production of vincristine and vinblastine, taking into account cytodifferentiation within cell aggregates, has been analyzed for the first time. Culture conditions such as light exposure and plant growth regulator regimes have been shown to affect cell differentiation. Moreover, cell differentiation was observed to be closely related to vincristine and vinblastine titers. Results provide important clues into the comprehension ofin vitroculture performance for metabolites production requiringin vivocell differentiation. They demonstrated the utility of taking into account cell differentiation for the further development of novel advanced processes of differentiated cell suspension cultures for producing valuable molecules, including biological medicines such as vincristine and vinblastine.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2228/1229

Biosynthesis of polygalacturonase was carried out under pre-optimized conditions employing solid-state fermentation at a pilot scale using wheat bran. The enzyme was subjected to a series of steps for purification including ion-exchange chromatography. After that, the purified enzyme was characterized and its kinetics and thermodynamic parameters along with the effect of immobilization on its performance were studied. Finally, a purified acidic enzyme was tested for its clarifying abilities on fresh apple juice. Purification fold of 2.98 was attained with increased specific activity of 256U/mg. Purified polygalacturonase showed a molecular weight of 38 kDa, optimum temperature of 50°C, optimum pH of 5, 50% stability at 50°C, and 84% stability at pH 5. The “Vmax” and “Km” of the enzyme were evaluated to be 250U/mg and 0.11mg/mL, respectively for hydrolyzing pectin. From the Arrhenius plot, activation energy (Ea), enthalpy of activation (ΔH), and entropy of activation (ΔS) were found to be 6.35 KJ/mol, 3.67 KJ/mol, and -1.1KJ/mol, respectively. Among metal ions, most of the tested Organic solvents and inhibitors inhibited the activity. Nano emulsion-based pectinase exhibited better stability. The enzyme was found to be an effective agent for the clarification of fresh apple juice.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2355/1235

Culture media and oxygen transfer were studied to improve the production ofR.phaseoliin chemically defined and undefined media for scale-up from shake flasks to a pneumatic bioreactor. The effects of carbon and phosphate onR. phaseoligrowth were evaluated, and the specific volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) was determined in shake flasks and scale-up to bioreactors. Six-fold more viable biomass was obtained by increasing the phosphate concentration by 7.5-fold when using glucose. However, this increase was not observed when succinate was used. In the undefined medium, glucose induced a higher production ofR.phaseoliin comparison with other carbon sources. The KLa of 6–11 h-1produced a five-fold growth of biomass in shake-flask cultures. This KLa was used to produce aR. phaseoli-based inoculant in a bioreactor. The formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules was confirmed in bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris). The improvement of culture media with a suitable oxygen transfer demonstrates thatR. phaseolican be used as an inoculant that exerts beneficial effects on the initial growth of bean plants.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2297/1240

Probiotic and fruit pulp were encapsulated separately by means of the spray-drying process and later incorporated into the food matrix. Water activity, hygroscopicity, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity were determined on the pulp fruit microcapsules. Meanwhile viability was measured on the microencapsulated probiotic. Both microparticles were incorporated in a food gel and its shelf-life stability was evaluated by measuring the evolution of the afore-mentioned parameters with time. The viability of probiotics (1x107CFU/mL) was highlighted.

These storage conditions were correlated with the hygroscopicity, glass transition temperature (Tg) and external morphology of these powders to minimize physical phenomena such as caking. The conditions of maximum stability according to the minimum integral entropy (DSint) for maltodextrins (DE10 and 20) fluctuated betweenaWof 0.12 to 0.25 at 25°C with hygroscopicity of 26 % andTgof 112 ° C, while for corn syrups (DE30 and 40)aWbetween 0.03 to 0.05 at 25°C, with hygroscopicity of 36% andTgof 89°C; For the same value inDEas the temperature increases, the humidity (M) and theaWof maximum stability decrease, while for the same temperature, the increase inDEalso decreases the humidity (M) andaWof maximum stability, maintaining their structural integrity without compaction; in extreme conditions, the powders showed a greater or lesser degree of caking.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2136/1207

Chocolate is a suitable vehicle of functional ingredients such as probiotics that improve health in people with diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical properties (texture, instrumental color, and water activity) and the consumer's acceptability of sugar-free dark chocolate formulation added withL. plantarum299v (L299v) andL. acidophilusLa 3 (DSMZ 17742). Sweeteners tested were polydextrose (Pol), inulin (Inu), isomalt (Iso), and stevia (Stev) applied in the following combinations: Pol+Inu and Iso+Stev, with and without probiotics (Prob). Probiotics addition in dark chocolate was feasible, maintaining their viability in the final product while not affecting the physicochemical and sensory acceptability of dark chocolate. Sweeteners addition significantly affected the physiochemical and sensory acceptability of the product where chocolates added with Iso+Stev showed the nearest value to the control.

The material processed by LTLT presented the lowest decrement of ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity (DPPH). Rates of losses of ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS) were described by a first order kinetics. The rate constants obtained were higher for HTST pulp, except for the antioxidant capacity determined by ABTS which was slightly higher for LTLT pulp. The t1/2values were, consequently, larger for LTLT pulp indicating a longer time for deceasing the concentration of the bioactive and the antioxidant capacity. Five main phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC: gallic, trans-ferulic and caffeic acids, rutin, and quercetin and the observed increment of the intensity of quercetin peak for LTLT treated pulp could be due to the breakage of rutin. Both pasteurization methods reduced microbial loads to recommended standards and LTLT reduced it more pronouncedly. LTLT pasteurization could be recommended the best alternative for the pasteurization of this pulp.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2222/1210

Alginate (A) and xanthan gum (XG) were selected as wall materials. Three formulations were used to encapsulate the protein hydrolysate from germinated soybean (PHGS) by ionic gelation followed by freeze-drying. Duringin vitrodigestion, the microstructure was monitored by ESEM, and the site-specific release of beads was confirmed by fermentation under colonic conditions with human inoculum. All beads were probed to resistin vitrodigestion, preserving their structure at the end of digestion. The release of protein during digestion was lower for the beads containing A+XG than for those with only A. The beads with A released 19.38±1.58% of the protein, and the beads containing A+XG released 17.32±0.29% for 0.3% XG and 7.19 ±0.00% for 0.5% XG. During fermentation, the beads containing A+XG produced a high concentration of short-chain fatty acids and lower unfermented residue in comparison with those made only with alginate. All formulations protected PHGS from conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract and proved to be fermentable by the intestinal microbiota; thus, they can be used as controlled release systems for protein hydrolysate in the colon.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2319/1212

In the present study, the characteristics of microparticles of soy protein isolate (SPI) obtained by microfluidization (MF) (110 MPa and 3 MF cycles) of aggregates obtained by heat treatment (95 °C for 15 min) and different pH values (3 , 5, 7 and 9). The results of particle size, zeta potential and turbiscan stability index (TSI) showed that the least stable microparticles in suspension were obtained at pH 5, due to their proximity to the average isoelectric point of soy proteins (4.5). In contrast, the most stable microparticles in suspension were obtained at pH 9, presenting small particle sizes (398.35 ± 4.19nm) and a low TSI (0.8 ± 0.08). By means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) it was possible to observe the breakdown of the aggregates for the formation of microparticles during the microparticulation process. Surface roughness and image texture analyses allowed evaluating the effect of MF on the surface of the microparticles. The most relevant descriptor for the characterization of microparticlers was the second angular moment whereas contrast, correlation, inverse difference moment, entropy, and fractal dimension did not correlate with the characteristics of the images in the whole range of operating conditions given that their calculation algorithms are not sensitive enough to detect the small variations in roughness of the samples. The best conditions for production of microparticels were 3 cycles of MF and pH 9 which gave place to homogenous and stable systems.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2311/1215

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method citric acid functionalization was also performed as comparison. The obtained carbonaceous supports were used to synthesize the Pt/C-MeOH and Pt/C-CA nanocatalysts. The effectiveness of the surface treatment was assessed by using them as support for Pt/C nanocatalysts and conducting investigations towards the Ethanol Oxidation Reaction (EOR). The most active nanocatalyst was Pt/C-MeOH2 (0.15 mol L-1MeOH and 8 min heating) which generated a current of 63.7 mA cm-2. In situ SPAIRS measurements showed that the EOR at Pt/C-MeOH2 and Pt/C-CA1 follows a C2-pathway mechanism. Meanwhile, a competition between the C1 and C2 pathway was observed at Pt/C. The study demonstrated that the IMH functionalization of Vulcan with MeOH produces carbon supported Pt nanocatalysts with enhanced catalytic activity for the EOR, with potential application in Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2346/1230

Alumina and alumina-ceria catalytic supports (AC) were prepared by the sol-gel method. Pt catalysts were obtained by IWI and characterized by AAS, TPR, and FTIR. It was found the calcined catalysts (PtOx/AC) increased the dehydration capacity when compared to their respective catalytic supports, both series with no appreciable dehydrogenation products. The reduced catalysts (Pt0/AC) showed high dehydrogenation activity in 2-propanol reactions, with high selectivity towards acetone and hydrogen at low temperatures. These catalytic systems present a change in selectivity towards propylene above 230°C and the loss of activity of Pt-reduced species. This deactivation was related with the bands of asymmetric vibrations of C-H and C-O bonds in the post-reaction material characterized by FT-IR, which have been attributed to either carbon deposition or oxygenated intermediates chemisorbed on Pt surface. Moreover, the temperature range, where Pt0is deactivated, is progressively shifted to higher values as the amount of ceria increases. This is attributed to the fact that ceria modifies the surface interactions of Pt sites with the molecules that cause deactivation. Catalysts were completely regenerated with a mild treatment in a N2flow at 500ºC.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2360/1236

In this work, an algorithm little studied in the segmentation of images is defined and that is also applicable in the processing of videos of biological systems, especially, the cultivation of microalgae in Raceway bioreactors. This algorithm is known as the Fast Distance Transform (FDT) and when operating it with the morphological skeleton, an algorithm capable of determining the number of objects in an image and separating them is generated. With the above, it is possible to give individual monitoring, to describe the behaviour of microalgae inside a Raceway bioreactor.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2294/1226

This type of reactors comprise an aerobic tank (where the biochemical reactions take place) and a membrane tank (where the final filtration process occurs). Mathematical modeling of these systems is a practical tool for the design, control and optimization of wastewater treatment plants. Among the modeling approaches, there is no mathematical model that is specifically designed for membrane bioreactors, and that captures the hierarchical nature of these systems. In the present work, new mathematical models for mass and momentum transport are derived from the fundamental equations at the continuum level. With the use of the volume averaging method, effective medium models for both the aerobic and membrane tanks were developed. This modeling approach has the advantage that the coefficients involved in the model can be predicted from closure schemes, without representing a demanding computational effort. This deterministic model allows predicting the most favorable design and operating conditions. Additionally, numerical simulations of these models give rise to a better understanding of the involved mass transport mechanisms in the membrane tank, this is achieved through the prediction of the fluid velocity, and the dynamics of the total mass flux and the concentration at each point in the tank. The models derived here are valuable because they allow analyzing the effect of each (operational and/or design) parameter over the dynamics of long-chain fatty acids and oxygen concentrations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2368/1227

Mathematical analysis provided complementary information for applications at the real scale. The pretreatments consisted of autoclaving (120 °C, 1.2 atm, 60 min), which generated the semisolid, and homogenization (30000 rpm, 1 minute). The semisolid was the substrate for a biochemical methane production test, which was carried out at room temperature with a substrate to inoculum ratio of 3:1. The methane production kinetics were complex and followed a stepped curve with four stages: 1) an exponential phase, 2) a transient methanogenesis inhibition phase, 3) a recovery phase and 4) a stationary phase. FTIR analysis showed that both the wastewater and semisolid had high contents of aliphatic and nitrogen compounds, while anaerobic digestion led to reductions of amines I and II, other amides, and aliphatic structures and the production of several amino acids. Mathematical models employed to predict cumulative methane production (Gompertz, Richards, Luedeking-Piret, and Modified first-rate) showed a good fit and low percentage error, although none of them accurately forecasted the transient inhibited steady-state (2nd phase).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2012/1199

The biomaterial was characterized by a nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm applying the BET equation, obtaining a surface area of 2.105 m2/g. FTIR reported the presence of hydroxyl, carbonyl, alcohol and methoxy groups. SEM analysis showed that the surface of the tuna shell has the presence of mesopores and that after adsorption Pb (II) forms micro-complexes and precipitations in the exposed area due to ion exchange with the functional groups. EDS analysis after adsorption confirmed a high content of the metal in the tuna shell. 0.1 g of adsorbent and 90 mg/L were determined as the best conditions for adsorption, reporting a maximum removal capacity of 40.97 mg/g.

In this article, a pilot plant was used to treat a synthetic wastewater (SWW) containing a mixture of dyes. Initially, the capacity of a fungal/bacterial sludge to remove this type of contaminants on a 1L scale was determined. Subsequently, the operating conditions that favor tertiary treatment were selected by using TiO2/UV photocatalysis and finally the complete treatment plant was integrated and evaluated (Pre-treatment, secondary treatment and tertiary treatment).

Anaerobic digestion of vinasse is a low-cost method treatment that produces useful byproducts such as biogas. However, at anaerobic digestion of vinasse, a part of the organic matter, which includes melanoidins and phenolic compounds cannot be eliminated producing a wastewater named biomethanated vinasse (BV). It has been reported that fungi that produce ligninolytic enzymes can degrade recalcitrant compounds in raw vinasses but there is little information on the use of these microorganisms in the treatment of BV. In this work, seven fungi (Trametes hirsutaBm-2 and AHB-6,Phanerochaete chrysosporiumBm-4,Cochliobolus lunatusAHB-1, andAthelia rolfsiiAT5, AT13 and AT7) were evaluated for degrading BV. The pathogenic fungiC. lunatusandA. rolfsiispecies were not able to support the high concentration of toxic compounds present on the BV plate. On the other hand,Trametes hirsuta(Bm-2 and AHB-6) andPhanerochaete chrysosporium(Bm-4) can degrade and remove phenolic compounds present in BV in liquid medium. However, the Bm-2 strain it was the only microorganism able to produce a visible change in the color of the medium with a concentration of 25% BV, achieving 68.8% decolorization and 65.58% phenolic compound removal rate, with a maximum laccase activity (3415.9 U/ml) at 144 h.

The aim of this study was to examine the biosorption of Co2+byLemna gibba(LG) after pretreatment with various compounds to improve its biosorption capacity. Of the original pretreatments, K2HPO4(0.1 M) produced the best biosorption capacity of Co2+by LG (31.21 ± 0.29 mg g-1vs 18.87 ± 0.19 mg g-1for the untreated control). Subsequently, the optimal concentration (0.3 M) of K2HPO4was found (the pretreatment herein denominated PLG), showing a biosorption capacity of 40.13 ± 0.18 mg g-1at pH 7.0. The pseudo-second order model most adequately fit the experimental kinetics. According to the proximate chemical analysis, the pretreatment enhanced the biosorption capacity (PLG vs LG) by improving sorption site availability through the elimination of salts, and by increasing the negative charge of the plant cell surface (from -26 to -35 mV), thus favoring the approach of positively charged Co2+. The ATR-FTIR analysis of PLG demonstrated that its hydroxyl, carboxyl, amide and amine groups importantly contributed to Co2+removal. Thus, PLG is a promising biosorbent material for Co2+removal from aqueous solutions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2042/1206

To avoid the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), it is necessary to treat the water with the presence of iron to reduce the environmental impact and obtain water that can be reused. In this work, electrodialysis is proposed for removing iron from a solution. To do this, it is necessary to know the appropriate conditions of current density, pH, and concentration to carry out the removal of iron in an analogous solution in concentration to those found in mineral processing. The electrodialysis tests were performed in a two-compartment cell. From the data obtained in the chemical analysis, the removal percentages, the amounts of mass removed, and the removal rates were calculated to determine the best operating parameters. Discussion is also made from the thermodynamics that determines the speciation of iron in the anolyte. The maximum percentage of iron removal reached was 97.15%, with the next parameters: current density of 390 A/m2, initial iron concentration (CFe) of 40 mg/L, initial pH value (pHi) of 4, agitation speed (v) of 500 r.p.m. and temperature (T) of 25°C.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2307/1218

In a stationary (batch) system, the experimental parameters that affect biosorption, such as NC dose, pH, temperature, and initial MB concentration were evaluated.

The kinetic data were better adjusted to the pseudo-second-order model, which indicates that biosorption seems to be controlled by chemisorption, the intraparticular diffusion model indicates that diffusion in the pores is the limiting factor throughout the biosorption process.

We discussed how the Stock Exchange manipulates ICO2 values through their calculation methods. Companies that participate in the ICO2 market have competitive advantages over stakeholders, even though they have agreed to abide by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires transparency regarding how the reduction of greenhouse gases emission occurs.

In comparison to virgin PP, the reprocessed polymer presented a higher carbonyl index, higher melt flow index, lower average molecular weight, and narrower polydispersity. Changes in these parameters became more pronounced as the processing time and temperature increased. Additionally, two different behavior regions were identified, the first one spanning between 240 - 260 °C, and the second one comprising higher temperatures (280 °C).

This system would be able to satisfy the needs of residents who do not have drinking water and live in rural areas. The design begins with the evaluation of the energy demand required for the ultraviolet light lamp and the water pump, which are powered by the photovoltaic panel. The system consists of a tank for water collection, a 0.5 HP pump, a pre-filter and a filter for sediments, an activated carbon filter, a UV-C light lamp and a storage tank. Mandatory control parameters according to DIGESA were evaluated such as pH, color, turbidity, thermotolerant and total coliforms present in the water, before and after the treatment. The results obtained demonstrate that the system works efficiently. The observed values ​​were lower than the maximum permissible limits for the physicochemical and microbiological analysis. For total and thermotolerant coliforms, 0 CFU / 100 mL were found, demonstrating that UV-C radiation completely eliminates the microorganisms present in water.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2298/1223
