Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Chemical composition of rainwater collected from 2006 to 2009 in Mexico City and at a rural site at Morelos State, south central Mexico","The objective of the study was to evaluate the chemical composition of rainwater in urban and suburban areas of central Mexico to identify the possible sources of rainwater contamination. The rainwater was collected at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico, Campus Ciudad Universitaria (CU), in the southern part of Mexico City at 2200 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.). CU has many green areas with high to moderate traffic densities where air quality presents serious problems of pollution by particulate matter. The other sampling site is a forested rural area (Tlalnepantla), State of Morelos, Mexico, a suburban area 86 km to the south of Mexico City. A total of 145 rainwater samples were collected in the rain period from 2006 to 2009. The ions analyzed were the following: SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, HCO3-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+and H+. Ammonium was the most abundant cation in both sites and is one of those responsible for the neutralization of acidic compounds in the atmosphere. The relative abundance of the inorganic anions present in the rainwater was in the following order: SO42-> NO3-> Cl-, for the alkaline metals the order was Ca2+>Mg2+> Na+> K+and Ca2+>Mg2+>K+>Na+for CU and Morelos, respectively. A correlation analysis shows a strong positive correlation among the ions, indicating that the most important source was anthropogenic. Air mass back trajectories were associated with the SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+and H+concentrations observed on each rainy day. Four factors were used in the statistic analysis and was weighted within each factor. Weights greater than 0.5 are considered to be significant components of each factor. The four factors explain 84.7 % of the total variance of all of the data for CU and 66.9 % for Morelos. All of these factors were associated with all of the analyzed ions. Air pollutant back trajectories were used to understand atmospheric transport and to identify the origins and pathways of air masses influencing the concentrations of the measured ions in rainwater.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1101/1383
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Revisiting the Cupidito unit (Cupido Formation) along peritidal carbonates from northeastern Mexico,"Depositional episodes are readily identified along representative localities of the Lower Cretaceous Cupido platform in northeastern Mexico. The basal part of the Cupido Formation exhibits a progradational reef platform that, at the upper limit, is truncated by a sequence boundary defined by a breccia. This breccia marks the development of a peculiar sedimentary facies informally known as the Cupidito unit, a distinctive stratigraphical unit in northeastern Mexico that remained uninterpreted for decades. Through the analysis of facies, microfacies and stable isotope comparisons from representative localities (Potrero Chico, Potrero de García, La Huasteca, La Muralla and Puerto Mexico) and from other previously reported outcrops, this work describes six diagnostic features for Cupidito and an improved stratigraphic model is proposed. The depositional sequence suggests a broad flat-topped platform with a general low organic productivity and restricted conditions followed by recurrent inundations of lagoon waters. Before drowning, this carbonate platform remained under equilibrium conditions interrupted by short pulses of relative higher-temperatures (48.3 °C and 39.2 °C). Coral-rudist-stromatoporoid patch-reefs with inferred inter-tropical temperatures between 31.5 °C and 32.2 °C originated as a progradational response to the instauration of a new Sequence Boundary at the base of Cupidito.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1095/1384
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Curie Point Depth and thermal flux in the offshore basins zone of Argentina,"In order to know the thermal distribution and its relationship with tectonic structures studies were conducted in front of the Argentine coast, in the area corresponding to the platform, slope and abyssal plain, in the region ranging from 50° to 66° West and 36° to 50° South. Fourier analysis of the potential fields allows us estimating the Curie point depth (CPD). The variation of the depth to the Curie point is an indicator of lithospheric thermal anomalies, some of which would be associated with variations in lithospheric thickness linked to the phenomena that took place during the separation of the Gondwana continent and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, such as basins and transfer zones. Maps of Curie point depth and thermal flow were made. These maps were correlated with an isostatically compensated crust 3D model and a crust-upper mantle discontinuity depth 3D model, calculated by gravimetric inversion. This comparative analysis allowed us to interpret tectonic structures, crustal thickness and isostatic decompensation degree on the study area. Higher depths to the Curie point were obtained in the continental crust zone (between 30 and 15 km, approximately) than in the oceanic zone (between 25 and 10 km, approximately). On the continental crust, the shallowest values ​​were found in the offshore basins sectors, in the oceanic crust, the deepest values are below the crust-upper mantle discontinuity level. Offshore basins are associated with lithospheric thinning accompanied by thermal anomalies indicated by elevations of the CPD. The oceanic basement would be linked to descending asthenospheric currents that produce an increase in its depth and CPD. The isostatic model shows a deeper mantle than the gravimetric one in sectors of offshore and shallow basins in the oceanic crust zone. The isostatic model shows a deeper mantle then the gravimetric one in the offshore basins sectors and shallower in the oceanic crust zone.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1038/1376
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Shark and ray fauna of the Tirabuzón Formation (Pliocene) in El Álamo Canyon, Sierra de Reforma - Aguajito, Baja California Sur, Mexico","In this paper we present the results of a stratigraphic and paleontological study of new fossil localities found in the La Reforma and El Aguajito Calderas, Baja California Sur, Mexico, approximately 30 km north of the town of Santa Rosalía. The studied sedimentary succession is part of the substrate of the Pleistocene Calderas and is related to the Tirabuzón Formation (Pliocene) of the Santa Rosalía basin. During the Pliocene-Pleistocene the boundary of the Santa Rosalía basin extended beyond these volcanic structures and therefore the El Álamo canyon site recorded stratigraphic and paleontological evidences of the Tirabuzon Formation with abundant shark teeth and ray fossils and interbedded volcanic deposits. Shark fauna had previously been reported for the Tirabuzón Formation, to the south of the study area, but not at the El Álamo canyon. The same lithology and fossil assemblage was found in other locations: Corkscrew Hill, Santa María, Cueva Amarilla, El Morro Prieto and El Gringo. The studied material consists of 500 individual specimens of elasmobranch fossil teeth (macroteeth). We report 17 species and two genera of sharks, one species, and six genera of rays and, for the first time, a Batoid fauna for the Tirabuzón Formation. Discordantly on top of the Cimarrón siltstone appears the 2.4 Ma Cueva Amarilla ignimbrite of the Inferno Formation. The faunal assembly corresponds to a shallow and warm marine environment, similar to the current fauna of the Eastern Tropical Pacific.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1421/1377
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Temporal and spatial hydrogeochemical evolution and lead isotopic composition of a contaminated stream of Taxco, Guerrero, Mexico","Discharge of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) produced within flooded mines is a major environmental issue in most polymetallic mining sites severely impacting nearby natural resources and producing a serious menace to the ecosystem and humans. The identification of both natural and anthropological factors influencing the bioavailability of toxic elements is relevant in revealing their behavior but also in the design of strategies for mitigating adverse effects to the environment. For these purposes, we carried out a spatial and seasonal hydrogeochemical (total and soluble contents) and a lead isotopic study of the AMD of the Xochula stream in the mining region of Taxco, Guerrero, in southern Mexico. The AMD is produced by the periodic discharge from the flooded Guerrero mine to the Xochula stream and is characterized by low to moderate pH, high sulfate, and high total and soluble metal contents. The AMD shows significant spatial but smaller temporal variations. Flow of AMD through a culvert made of concrete produces the most important chemical changes recorded regardless of the time of year significantly decreasing the electrical conductance and the concentration of total and soluble potentially toxic elements. Distribution of metals and As between dissolved and particulate-bound species is pH-controlled. Due to the short interaction time between the AMD and bedrock and the formation of coatings, lithology plays a minor role in neutralization, whereas mixing of AMD with freshwater is only significant in the less acidic segment of the stream. Neutralization of AMD entails a significant decrease of the concentration of both total and soluble metals and As and chemical speciation indicates that oxides, carbonates and sulfates are the reactive phases. The Pb isotopic composition reveals that metals derive from the Taxco ore deposit and that AMD is influenced by rocks of the Morelos and Taxco Schist formations.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1087/1378
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Modeling landslide volume using geomorphologic analysis in the southern flank of Pico de Orizaba Volcano, Mexico.","In this research, the relationship between surface area and volume of landslides in a volcanic watershed is presented, together with the geomorphological analysis of landforms that may lead to slope instability. The use of this method allows a better understanding of the potential landslide volume contribution along homogeneous units. The analysis is supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the use of drones, and statistical techniques to create a comprehensive method for landslide volume estimation for each landform. This approach is applied to the Río Chiquito-Barranca del Muerto watershed on the south flank of Pico de Orizaba volcano, Mexico. The watershed is prone to gravitational processes because of its physical geographical conditions (highly weathered volcanic and sedimentary deposits that form hilly and steep terrains which are affected by extreme seasonal precipitation) and anthropogenic conditions (deforestation and land use change). In the area, more than six hundred landslides were mapped and grouped into different forms of relief. In the study area, representative landslides were measured in detail with the help of a drone to establish an empirical relationship between the area of the landslide and its volume. This relationship, expressed as a power law with a scale exponent, was used to estimate the potential contribution of the material produced by the landslides in each form of the relief, already pre-established in the basin. The study shows that the method can be useful in remote places with difficult access and sparse topographic information. It also shows that sedimentary landforms contribute with more sediments per square kilometer, even though, they have less landslides than the volcanic landforms.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1548/1379
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Imprints of historical pollution and the 218-60 BCE tsunamigenic period in southwestern Spain,"The Doñana National Park is a Biosphere Reserve located within the estuary of the Guadalquivir River (SW Spain). It is mainly composed of extensive fluvio-tidal marshes partially protected by an elongated sandy spit. Three phases have been distinguished in the late Holocene evolution of this spit based on textural, geochemical, palaeontological and, chronological data recorded in a long core (31 m). Phase 1 (890 BCE-218 BCE) is characterized by the alternation of lagoonal silty sediments and slightly polluted marsh deposits, the latter with contamination from thousand-year-old mining. Phase 2 (218 BCE-90 CE) is characterized by several historical tsunamis, which caused the erosion of previous dune systems and the deposit of these sandy sediments on the adjacent bottom of the lagoon. Phase 3 (90 CE-Present) includes a regressive sequence (lagoonal bottom-marsh-dune system), with the pollution of lagoonal sediments due to Roman mining activities.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1543/1381
