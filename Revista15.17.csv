Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,La estructura cortical del arco de las Antillas Menores estimada a partir de la técnica de funciones receptoras,"By applying receiver functions technique we studied the crustal thickness and mechanical properties of the Lesser Antilles Arc. We gathered teleseismic data recorded from broadband stations deployed along the arc by different networks. The analysis of P-to-S conversion and crustal reverberations allowed us to estimate the Moho depth and the average crustal Vp/Vs ratio under nine stations. The results were corroborated with forward gravimetric modeling of the long wavelength component of the Complete Bouguer Anomaly along the structure. The Moho depth ranges between 22 and 32.4 km. The distribution of thick and thin crust is closely related to variations of the convergence rate of the subducted lithosphere at the Tiburón fault system. Poisson's ratio ranges between 0.266 (Vp/Vs = 1.777) and 0.3 (Vp/Vs = 1.870). Higher values are consistent with a Mesozoic basement, related to the Greater Antilles Arc, found in the northern section of the Lesser Antilles Arc.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/440/369
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Roedores caviomorfos (Rodentia Hydrochoeridae) del Blancano temprano-tardío – Irvingtoniano de los estados de Guanajuato, Jalisco y Sonora, México: relación con Phugatherium dichroplax","The Caviomorphs rodents collected in the late Blancan sedimentary sequence of San Buenaventura, in the Tecolotlán Basin, Jalisco, are described. The study and comparison with Neochoerus cordobae fossils collected in the early Blancan San Miguel Allende region have revealed that the Buenaventura specimens have more progressive characters than N. cordobae. Distinguishing features of the new species are: 1) the secondary internal flexid (h.t.i.), in the second prism of m2, divides the prism in two isolated plates; 2) the secondary external flexid (h.s.e.), in m3 exceeds 50% of the prism, and 3) the secondary internal flexid (h.s.i.), in both m1 and m3 has a 90% depth of the prism. These characters are shared with a specimen collected from late Blancan-Irvingtonian sedimentary deposits exposed at Golfo de Santa Clara, Sonora, which is referred to Neochoerus occidentalis. The taxonomic position of Neochoerus cordobae and Phugatherium dichroplax from the late Blancan fauna of 111 Ranch, Arizona is also discussed. The presence of Neochoerus occidentalis in Tecolotlán and in the Golfo de Santa Clara faunas is evidence that the western part of Mexico was a corridor where mammals migrated toward the northern region of Mexico and in general to the SW portion of North America.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/445/371
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Análisis metalogenético preliminar del depósito vetiforme en la mina La Ye, Antoquia, Colombia: características geológicas, isotópicas y estructurales","La Ye is a shear-zone hosted lode gold type deposit with brittle-ductile deformation which produced wallrock mylonitization, sigmoidal structures, boudinage and reactivation of vein-wallrock contact. At least four deformation events were identified, two of them are related to mineralization processes: Qz + Py ± Au for D2 sectors (dextral shear zones) and Qz + Py + Cp + Gn + Au-Ag tellurides + Pb tellurides + Au for D3 sectors (sinistral shear zones). Hydrothermal alterations and paragenetic association suggest that H2S o HS- ligand species were the predominant sulfur species in ore fluids and, in consequence, Au(HS)2- was likely the gold-transporting complex. Recrystallized quartz textures suggest low temperature (<350 °C) and brittle-ductile conditions. The δ18O values of hydrothermal muscovite associated to first mineralization stage and D2 event are +7.4 y +8.9‰, and the δD values are -49 y -50‰. The δ18O values of hydrothermal muscovite associated to second mineralization stage (and main event) and D3 event are +7.3 y +8.6‰, and the δ D values are -46 y -57‰. The δ34S values of pyrite associated to first mineralization stage and D2 event are +3.7 y +4.9‰ and δ34S values of pyrite associated to second mineralization stage (and main event) and D3 event are +3.95 y +5‰. These isotopic values are compatible with a magmatic and/or metamorphic origin for the ore fluids. These geological characteristics including structural controls, nature host-rock, hydrothermal alterations, mineralization style and isotopic composition of δ18O, δD and δ 34S suggest that La Ye deposit is compatible with the Orogenic Gold Deposits of Granitoid-Hosted Lode-gold Deposits subtype.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/447/372
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Evolución del relieve de un frente montañoso y respuesta del sistema erosivo fluvial ante el forzamiento causado por la actividad tectónica (Andes centrales, provincia de San Juan, Argentina)","In the eastern piedmont of the Central Precordillera, in central western Argentina, relief is subject to recurrent Quaternary tectonic activity, which impacts the fluvial system. The goal of the present study is to analyze the relief evolution of a mountain front and to understand how the erosive river system responds to tectonic forcing, using geomorphology and morphometric indices. The analyzed indices are: Stream Length-gradient (SL), Strahler Integral, and Asymmetry Indices (F). These indices were applied to three sectors of the northeastern piedmont of cerro Zonda , one before the escarpment system, another one between escarpments, and a third one in the post-escarpment sector. Longitudinal profiles were analyzed for seven streams that are part of this piedmont basin. Image analysis and fieldwork allowed proposing a morphometric index, called Exposure Index, which results from the existing quotient between areas of exposed Miocene outcrops and areas of Quaternary cover (EI).",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/449/373
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Reconstructing the paleoenvironment of Loltún Cave, Yucatán, Mexico, with Pleistocene amphibians and reptiles and their paleobiogeographic implications","Loltún cave in Yucatán peninsula is an important fossil site. The cave preserves Pleistocene fauna and lithic tools, and it is among the few sites with amphibian and reptile fossils of the Mexican Pleistocene. We used the fossil amphibians and reptiles community to reconstruct the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of Loltún cave in the Late Pleistocene. The Pleistocene amphibian and reptiles community in Loltún cave consists of one frog, three lizards, five snakes and one turtle. Applying the Habitat Weighting method to the fossil herpetofaunal assemblage, we inferred a vegetation mosaic non-analog with the present one, comprising evergreen seasonal forest, tropical deciduous forest and scrub forest, in contrast to the tropical semi-deciduous forest found nowadays around Loltún cave. Using the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method we inferred a mean annual temperature of 25.33 °C and a mean annual precipitation of 1183.74 mm; the temperature was 1.47 °C lower and the MAP was 85.14 mm higher than the present climate condition.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/441/370
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Decoupled lake history and regional moisture availability in the middle elevations of tropical Mexico,"During the Holocene, most of the climatic variability in the tropics has manifested through changes in the precipitation regime. Although there is relatively a large amount of information on this climatic variability from the lowlands during this time period, little is known regarding the environmental variability in the middle elevations. Here we present evidence of environmental change from a lacustrine sedimentary record recovered from Lake Lacandón, a small shallow water body located in the middle elevations of Chiapas, Mexico. Through analyses of cladoceran assemblages and chemical properties of the sediments (concentrations of C, Ca, N, Rb, Sr, Ti, and Zr), we aimed to reconstruct local and regional environmental conditions during the last 4,000 years. Our results show a highly dynamic cladoceran community apparently associated with changes in the size of the lake, which although variable has been enlarging through the last 4,000 years.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/450/374
