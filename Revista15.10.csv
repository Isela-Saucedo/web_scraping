Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Ambiental pollen-based metodology for hydrogeological studies in karstic zones: Joya de Luna-Guaxcamá, S.L.P.","Extensive outcrops of folded limestone rocks forming mountainous systems with intense karst development are found in areas of central Mexico. An important part of the water supply in these areas is derived from aquifers controlled by the karst system. We analyzed the underground flow between the towns of Joya de Luna (in an elevated part of the mountain) and Guaxcamá, topographically lower, to establish if there is a connection between these zones, and corroborate if the water infiltrated in the upper part is captured in lowland springs. A new method is proposed to qualitatively assess the hydraulic connectivity between the recharge and discharge zones in a karst and fractured system using pollen grains as tracers. Deuterium and oxygen-18 isotopic data were used to compare and evaluate the suitability of this method; in addition, excess deuterium was used as a factor in the hydrogeological analysis. Through a survey of the vegetation present within a 5 km radius in both zones, the pollen families existing in the recharge zone Joya de Luna and the discharge zone in Guaxcama were documented, and a database with 41 pollen species was generated for morphological characterization. Subsequently, 135 groundwater samples with suspended pollen grains were collected from 5 water wells in the recharge zone and 10 water springs in the discharge zone. The species analysis showed that pollen grains ofZea mays,Avena sativa,Cicer arietinumyQuercussp., characteristic only of the recharge zone, were also present in water samples collected in the discharge area. The pollen-based results were consistent with those obtained with isotopic data; they allowed identifying two routes with hydraulic connection, G1 and G2. For each of these routes an hydraulic connection was established between samples from the recharge zone and the discharge zone. Grains ofZea mays,Avena sativa, andCicer arietinumwere found in samples from both zones. Pollen ofQuercussp., characteristic of the mountainous are was detected three samples of the recharge zone and seven points of the zone of discharge.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/565/1142

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"The Permian-Triassic Intracratonic Magmatic Corridor of La Pampa province, Argentina: new U-Pb SHRIMP ages, Hf isotopic composition, and geodynamic implications","A study and review of the magmatic units that make up the Permian-Triassic Intracratonic Magmatic Corridor of La Pampa (CMPT-LP), south-central Argentina, has been carried out. New U-Pb SHRIMP ages, Hf isotopic composition, and chemical composition of some units of the CMPT-LP have been obtained, i.e. 1) Chacharramendi Syenogranite, age 254.7 ± 1.3 Ma (Late Permian, Lopingian), Hf model age of 1640 Ma",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/930/1144
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Apatite U-Pb dating at UNAM laboratories: analytical protocols and examples of its application,"Apatite is the most common phosphate mineral in the Earth’s crust and can be found in practically all magmatic and metamorphic rocks, as well as in ancient and recent sediments and in certain ore deposits. Its effective closure temperature of 450–550 °C for the U-Pb system makes apatite an important natural medium-temperature thermochronometer that can be dated by both laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP-MS) and isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID–TIMS) techniques. Due to its low U content, coupled with high Pb contents incorporated during crystallization (also called common lead), apatite U-Pb dating is analytically challenging, and requires robust analytical protocols to achieve reliable ages. In this experimental study we obtained apatite U-Pb ages from six rock samples employing LA–ICP-MS (at Laboratorio de Estudios Isotópicos, Centro de Geociencias, UNAM), while one sample was also dated by ID–TIMS (at Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquímica Isotópica, UNAM). These samples have igneous emplacement or metamorphic ages broadly ranging from the Neoproterozoic to the Paleocene. The obtained apatite U-Pb ages agree well with other radioisotopic data (U-Pb on zircon and K-Ar or Ar-Ar on micas and hornblende) available for the same rock samples tested, or for the same geological units studied. These apatite U-Pb results, obtained for the first time at two main Mexican geochronology laboratories, are precise enough to be geologically meaningful and usually represent the cooling ages; though, in some cases they may also indicate the crystallization or the metamorphic age. Some advantages and disadvantages of LA–ICP-MS- and ID–TIMS-based methodologies were observed and outlined. Our results validate the analytical procedures used and will serve as an important trigger towards the development or improvement of medium-temperature thermochronology techniques in Mexico.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/749/1145
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Analysis of geological fractures in the Agrícola Oriental 2C well, Mexico City, and its relationship with major faults","In the last years several exploratory wells have been drilled in Mexico City down to 2000 m depth, with the aim to explore deep aquifers to cover the water deficiency in the metropolitan area. In particular, in the Agricola Oriental 2C well, located in the Iztacalco municipality, several cores were recovered; one of them is 9 m long, located between 1550 and 1559 m depth. This core is situated close to the contact between an Oligocene volcanic unit and a Cretaceous limestone at ~1560 m depth. The study core shows that the volcanic rocks are affected by an important number of fractures, which can be divided into two families according to their intersection relationships and fill material (F1 and F2). The younger fractures (F2) are related with a fault, informally named here as Agricola Oriental fault, which sets in tectonic contact the sedimentary and the volcanic rocks.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/871/1147

Chancelloriid scleritomes partially articulated and isolated sclerites belonging toAllonnia tintinopsisandArchiasterellasp. are widely distributed in reddish calcilutite of the El Gavilán Formation, in the Sahuaral section, central Sonora. The faunal association is represented by chancelloriids, spicules of reticulosan sponges, linguliform brachiopods, hyoliths and trilobites. The El Gavilán Formation is an open shelf sequence of 65 m thick, composed of calcilutite interbedded with thin-bedded marly limestone. Trilobite association allowed assigning the open shelf deposit to the middle Cambrian,AltiocculusSubzone,EhmaniellaZone (Series 3, Stage 5). Chancelloriid genera of the El Sahuaral section may be compared with the biota of San Jose de Gracia, in central Sonora, México, and also with other mid-Cambrian shelf deposits around Laurentia as Burgess Shale in Canada and formations from Utah, USA. Cambrian rocks of Sonora were part of the southern-western border of Laurentia craton, which was located near the paleo-equator during Cambrian times.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/928/1148

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Susceptibility to flooding for torrential flows using the integration of the geomorphological method and the modelling with FLO-2D, lake Atitlán, Guatemala","Lake Atitlan (Guatemala) is located in the transit region of the tropical cyclones formed in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Every year, these phenomena cause abundant and intensive rain fall which in turn provokes floods associated with the formation of destructive flows. This paper aims to deepen the knowledge of such processes and the prediction of their spatial distribution. The work was carried out in the Tzununá basin, taking as reference phenomena Hurricane Stan (2005) and Tropical Storm Agatha (2010). When they passed through the region, maximum rain falls of 383 and 269 mm were registered on two consecutive days. In this work, the geomorphological method was developed and flows were simulated with different rheological properties using FLO-2D software. The geomorphological detailed exploration field work has been essential and has allowed the validation of some of the model results. It has also enabled us to discard others wich are not representative of real conditions. The integration of the results of both methodologies has made possible the creation of a more detailed and validated inundation susceptibility map.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/783/1149

This complex is formed by 11 stratigraphic units, which were subdivided into three sequences (1. pre-Ñadó, 2. Ñadó, and 3. post-Ñadó). The oldest unit of the pre-Ñadó sequence (La Florida Rhyolite) was dated at 30.81 ± 0.17 Ma and 31.71 ± 0.27 Ma by the U-Pb method in zircon, and can thus be related to the Oligocene felsic magmatism of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO). All other sequences can be temporarily correlated with previously reported episodes of late Miocene volcanism in the TMVB. The Ñadó composite volcano was built up during late Miocene by multiple effusive events of dacitic composition, including the emplacement of several lava flows, a spine (Peña Ñadó), and a dome (Cerro Pelón). This acid volcanism was contemporaneous with mafic volcanism, represented by scoria cones and basaltic lava flows. Finally, the post-Ñadó stage is represented by a series of andesites, ignimbrites from Amealco and Huichapan Calderas, mafic volcanism, lahars and fall deposits from Temascalcingo volcano. The geochemistry of the rocks shows some typical characteristics of subduction zones, such as enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) compared to high field strength elements (HFSE), negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, P, and Ti, as well as positive anomalies of Ba, K, Pb y Sr. The rare earth elements (REE) show an enrichment of light REE with respect to heavy REE, except for the Oligocene La Florida rhyolites, which show REE patterns with a typical “seagull” shape, which suggests a different origin compared with the younger samples. Geochemical characteristics suggest that the main petrological mechanism during the Ñadó evolution was the AFC.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/778/1150
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Protolith age of the Altar and Carnero complexes and latest Cretaceous–Miocene deformation in the Caborca–Altar region of northwestern Sonora, Mexico","In the Caborca–Altar area of northwest Sonora, variably deformed and metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks crop out in a northwest-southeast–trending belt (El Batamote belt) at least 70 km long. We obtained detrital zircon U-Pb ages from two distinctive components of the belt near Altar, here termed the Altar complex and Carnero complex. Zircon ages for metasandstone and metaconglomerate matrix from the Altar complex indicate a Late Cretaceous maximum age of sedimentation, with at least part of the complex no older than 77.5 ± 2.5 (2σ). Pre-Cretaceous detrital zircons in the complex were derived largely from local sources, including Proterozoic basement, the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian miogeocline and the Jurassic arc. The detrital zircon ages and lithologic character of the Altar complex suggest correlation with the Escalante Formation, the uppermost unit of the Upper Cretaceous El Chanate Group. In contrast, one sample from the Carnero complex yielded a Middle Jurassic maximum depositional age and a detrital zircon age distribution like that of the Jurassic eolianites of the North American Cordillera. The Carnero complex may correlate with the Middle Jurassic Rancho San Martín Formation but could also be a metamorphosed equivalent of the Upper Jurassic Cucurpe Formation, Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Bisbee Group, or El Chanate Group derived by recycling of Jurassic erg sandstones. The Late Cretaceous age for the Altar complex protolith contradicts models that relate deposition of the entire El Batamote protolith to a basin formed by oblique slip along the Late Jurassic Mojave-Sonora megashear. Instead, the belt is best explained as an assemblage of Middle Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous formations deformed and locally metamorphosed beneath a northeast-directed Laramide thrust complex. Potassium-argon and40Ar/39Ar ages confirm previous inferences that deformation of El Batamote belt occurred between the Late Cretaceous and late Eocene. A second phase of deformation, involving low-angle normal faults, occurred during and/or after intrusion of the ~22-21 Ma Rancho Herradura granodiorite.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/784/1151
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"New U-Th-Pb SHRIMP ages of the Complejo Volcánico Agua de la Piedra, Provincia Magmática Somún Curá, Patagonia, Argentina","During the Cenozoic, the northern extra-Andean Patagonia was characterized by an extensive magmatism, mainly Oligocene (25–28Ma) and basaltic, i.e. the Somún Curá plateau. Younger, post-plateau magmatism produces several polygenetic volcanic complexes (Alta Sierra de Somún Curá, Sierra de Apas, Sierra de Telsen, Sierra de Talagapa, Sierra Pire Mahuida, and Sierra de Chacays) and minor monogenetic centres (Trayén Niyeu Volcano, Dos Hermanos Hills), developed from Late Oligocene through Miocene times. Up to the present, the Agua de la Piedra Volcanic Complex has been considered a post-shield eruptive assemblage. This volcanic building is composed of basal pyroclastic flows of trachytic composition and lava flows and domes which span from trachyte and lesser amounts of rhyolite to late basaltic flows. The series is characterized by its alkaline composition and displays a typical compositional gap in the mesosilicic realm. The evolution from the basic rocks to the trachyte-rhyolite differentiates was controlled by early olivine-clinopyroxene fractionation and later by plagioclase + K feldspar crystallization. There are scarse geocronological data of this volcanic series. In order to precisely date the bimodal sequence, a trachyte lava flow (Puesto Navarrete; 32.32 +0.48 -0.98 Ma), which constitutes the core of the Complex, and another rhyolite flow (Puesto Suárez; 32.01 +0.51 -0.34 Ma) were selected to perform U–Pb Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) analyses. The basaltic facies was dated by K-Ar methodology at 24.4 ± 0.9 Ma. All in all, the ages pose new time constraints in the Agua de la Piedra Volcanic Complex within the evolutive context of the Somún Curá Magmatic Province. The new geochronological information obtained indicate that the trachytic and rhyolitic rocks would have formed synchronously or shortly before the main event that formed the plateau, while the ages of the basaltic rocks are bound to be coeval with other post plateau volcanic complexes.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/988/1154
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Rare earth elements dissolved in groundwater and its relation with the flow systems in marine and volcanic rocks in the Bajío of Guanajuato, central Mexico","Rare Earth Elements (REE) - series of lanthanides - were used to determine the water-rock interaction process in two geological provinces in central Mexico: the Mesa Central (MC) and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (FVTM). Ninety-four groundwater samples were collected from fractured and granular aquifers in the southwestern part of the State of Guanajuato, from which REE concentrations were analytically determined in all of the samples. The geochemical software PHREEQC was later used to determine aqueous speciation, saturation indices with respect to mineral phases and mixing. The results show that the anomalies of cerium (Ce) and europium (Eu) are characteristic in the determination of water-rock interactions. The negative anomalies of Ce are associated with groundwater circulating through a carbonated-marine Cretaceous aquifer; whereas the negative and positive anomalies of the Eu are associated to fractured aquifers of MC and FVTM. The REE are incorporated into the groundwater by dissolution of minerals present in the rocks and their concentration is controlled by pH, coprecipitation and sorption processes. The presence of negative anomalies of Ce, in the fractured and granular aquifers above the carbonated aquifer, suggests an hydraulic continuity between them through faults and fractures connected to depths greater than 1000 m. This behavior is consistent with the Gravitational model of Groundwater Flow Systems (GFS) Tóthian-Freezean, so the REEs act as natural tracers in defining the regional flow in this complex geological environment and confirming the importance of considering the residence time and vertical components of GFS in groundwater management.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/714/1155
