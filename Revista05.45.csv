As such, it has a broad range of functional and biological properties that can be exploited biotechnologically for diverse applications. Several studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic hydrolysis of whey proteins releases peptides that can perform biological activities, depending on the precise enzymatic process applied and the specific protein used. The present study examines the antimicrobial activity obtained from hydrolysates of protein concentrates of bovine whey by means of the aspartyl protease Eap1. It demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the following human non-opportunistic (Salmonella sp.) and opportunistic pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans), and then compares the findings obtained to the action of two commercial enzymes: trypsin (TP) and chymotrypsin (CMTP). Results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of the hydrolysates produced with Eap1 was higher than that generated by TP and CMTP. Also, the study determined that the Eap1 products were the only ones that inhibited growth of the yeast C. albicans.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/693/233

In the presence of 2 mM acetaldehyde, Ta1316 ADH showed a remarkable thermal activity, displaying activity at temperatures up tp 90”C and low pH with a requirement of Z+2to reach its maximum activity. In contrast to other characterized ADHs, Ta1316 ADH reduces methyl pyruvate, an alpha-ketoester as its preferred substrate. We conclude that Ta1316 ADH’s principalfunction is the reduction of substrates and is potentially an enzyme that can be used in biotechnology, as erll as in industrial applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/699/236

Orange peels are rich in cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, which can be used for the production of enzymes. In this study, oranges-colonizing fungi were isolated and identified by 5.8S rRNA-ITS ribosomal sequence analysis as Fusarium sp. N6C6, Cladosporium oxysporum N1C1, Mucor racemosus N9C1 and Penicillium minioluteum N3C2. These strains and Trichoderma reesei ATCC 26921 were used for the production of endoglucanases (EG), xylanases (XYL) and polygalacturonases (PGA) by solid-state fermentation using orange peels. P. minioluteum N3C2 obtained 6.5 U/g of dry peel (DP), the highest production of EG, surpassing T. reesei ATCC 26921 (3.3 U/g DP). T. reesei ATCC 26921 and P. minioluteum N3C2 obtained the highest production of XYL, at 14.7 and 14.5 U/g DP, respectively. The highest PGA production was obtained with Fusarium sp. N6C6 (16.5 U/g DP), followed by M. racemosus N9C1 (12.3 U/g DP), which produced less EG. C. oxysporum N1C1 produced EG (3.2 U/g DP) and PGA (8.0 U/g DP) but did not produce XYL. The strains studied possess great potential for the production of enzymes that could be used in the extraction of citric oils.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/697/235

In this study, the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were carried out using Plectranthus amboinicus leaf extract as reducing agent. The synthesized Ag NPs was characterized by using X-ray diraction, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. We further investigated the catalytic property of  the biosynthesized Ag NPs by degradation of methylene blue (MB) in the presence of sodium borohydride. Compared with commercial Ag NPs, the proposed Plectranthus amboinicus leaf extract-deduced Ag NPs exhibited a much higher catalytic performance due to the well dispersibility caused by the attachment of biomolecules on the Ag NPs surface.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/700/237

AND Gordonia sp. ON CAROTENOID PRODUCTION,"Carotenoids are important pigments, due to their antioxidant activity. The purpose of this research was to observe the effect of GYEA media with FeSO4 and FeCl2 on the total carotenoid content (TCC) and the carotenoid profile of Rhodococcus sp. and Gordonia sp. In the biomass of Rhodococcus sp., with 0.025% FeSO4 a TCC of 14.91±1.66 µg/g was calculated, and two carotenoids were observed; the Carotenoid 2, identified as an astaxanthin dirhamnoside like carotenoid increased from 13.450.52% in GYEA media without salts to 24.21±1.48% con 0.025% FeSO4 (valor de T de 11.81, α 0.05). With the biomass of Gordonia sp. in the presence of 0.025% FeCl2 a TCC of 28.66±8.21 µg/g was calculated and three carotenoids were observed, no significant increase was determined for these carotenoids.

EXTRACTS AND THEIR SATIETY EFFECT,"A phytochemical study of the hexane, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seeds was conducted. The effect of chia seeds aqueous extract on the weight gain of Wistar rats was also analyzed. The methanolic extract of the aerial part of the plant showed 268 fold more total flavonoids (268 ± 6 mEQ) compared to the chia seeds extract (1 pm 0.2 mEQ). However, the antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extract of the aerial part of the plant was low (2.0 ± 0.1 TEAC) compared to those reported for other plant extracts. Also, no toxicity was observed in A. Salina larvae for all the analyzed extracts. On the other hand, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) of weight between rats that consumed the aqueous extract of chia seeds and the control group that consumed water. There were also no changes in the consumption of food and liquids indicating that chia seeds aqueous extract did not produce the satiety effect that has been attributed to the seeds in other studies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/734/251

The metabolic products cinnamaldehyde, 3-phenylpropanal, 3-phenyl-1-propanol, 1-phenylpropane-1,3diol, 3-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1-propanone, hydrocinnamic acid, 2-phenylethanol, 1-phenylethane-1,2-diol, cinnamyl acetate, cinnamic acid and 3-phenyl propyl acetate were detected by GC-MS. The concentration of these products was clearly dependent on support. Thus, the bioprocesses with immobilized spores or whole cells into polyurethane foam were more eﬃcient to obtain 1-phenylpropane-1,3-diol, and allowed reusing the support at least 3 or 4 times without signiﬁcant loss of activity. However, under the same conditions, alginate and chitosan were inadequate supports for this purpose, and instead, 3-phenyl-1-propanol and cinnamic acid were the major metabolic compounds. Therefore, the biotransformation of cinnamyl alcohol using immobilized C. acutatum cells in polyurethane foam can potentially oﬀer a simple and eﬃcient way to obtain 1-phenylpropane-1,3-diol.There usability and inﬂuence of three supports (calciumalginate,chitosan and polyurethane foam) in the biotransformation of cinnamyl alcohol by the spores and whole cells from the Colombian native fungus Colletotrichum acutatum was evaluated.

The buffalo milk was subjected to drying by atomization, air temperature of 140°C inlet. The samples were evaluated at times 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days of storage. The moisture content, fat, protein, ash, density, acidity, solubility index, burning particles were analysed, along with structural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and proteomic study (SDS-PAGE). The production of milk powder from the set standards produced a buffalo milk powder with satisfactory results of physical and chemical compositions. In the SEM analysis was possible to observe an accumulation of milk powder particles with withered and wrinkled structures. Variations in the intensity of the bands of protein fractions were observed by electrophoresis, but no significant changes. The production secured buffalo milk powder with good quality characteristics, without any undesirable changes in the product during the storage time.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/736/253

Microstructure, rheology and sensory attributes of the yogurt variations were examined. Sucrose substitution (6 wt%) by stevia (0.02 wt%) in fullfat yogurt (2.6 wt%) and reduced-fat yogurt (1.3 wt%) produced more compact gel networks in which the presence of non-micellar material was observed between casein clusters. Viscoelastic moduli of the yogurt variations containing stevia were significantly higher than those of the yogurt variations containing sucrose. Incorporation of CC (1.3, 2.6 and 3.9 wt%) produced reduced-fat yogurt variations exhibiting a progressively more compact protein network, higher viscoelastic moduli and preference sensory scores comparable to those displayed by the full-fat yogurt made with sucrose. Yogurt variations incorporating CC exhibited high probiotic survivability (> 8.1 log cfu g−1 ) after 21 days of storage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/737/255

The objective was to determine the changes in the activity of the enzyme and in its structure. The results mainly showed an eect of reduction on the residual activity (RA) of the enzyme papain. The best effect on the RA (47.9%) was achieved under the most intense treatment conditions of EF (9 kV/cm) and time (30 min). The results in the structure analysis of papain by fluorescence spectroscopy showed that HVEF led to denaturation and possibly aggregation of the enzyme. Therefore, HVEF can be considered as an effcient alternative nonthermal technology that can be used for partial enzyme inactivation",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/742/257

MERRILL ESSENTIAL OIL","Physical, barrier, mechanical and microstructural properties of an edible film based on Aloe vera, gelatin-glycerol with different concentrations of the essential oil of a pepper (Pimenta dioica L. Merrill) at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% w / w were investigated. The optical properties showed low brightness and E of 59.6. In terms of water vapor permeability, the values ranged from 2.54 x10- 9± 0.09 to 4.49  109± 0.3 (g m/Pa s m2), due to the effect of decreased polarity in the structural matrix. In the case of the mechanical properties, an increase in the oil concentration significantly reduced the tensile strength, making the material more flexible (% E = 72 to 122), possibly due to the rearrangement of and the interaction between polysaccharides, proteins and plasticizers in the matrix. This behavior was also observed in the microstructural studies: the increased concentration of oil increased the roughness of the film (Ra = 0.222 to 2.12 mV). The results show that addition of Pimenta dioica oil to the film results in a film with increased WVP and resistant film qualities that favor the material for use in high-moisture food coating applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/750/263

LIQUOR,"The kinetic analysis of the stability of monomeric anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) liquor was performed as well as physicochemical evaluation of fresh fruit and liquor. °Brix, pH, titrable acidity, density and moisture content were evaluated for fresh fruit and results were similar to reported ones. Liquor was characterized during 180 days of aging in term of its physicochemical properties. Contents of monomeric anthocyanins (ACyMon) and ascorbic acid in backberry liquor agreed with reported data but kinetics of their change during aging has not yet been published. A first order kinetics described (R2 >90%) decrements of anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity. ACyMon, polymeric colour, total phenols, antioxidant capacity and ascorbic acid correlated well (R >0.7) with each other. Rate constants and half-life time for anthocyanins showed that they were more prone to degradation than ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity which decreased slower than anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, having a half-life time of 630.13 days. It was noteworthy that the relative rate of loss of ascorbic acid and total anthocyanins in relation to antioxidant capacity are both higher than 1 (4.54 and 5.09 respectively), due to the existence of other reactive species such as phenols that contributed to antioxidant capacity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/758/265

A comparison between the formed films using the mucilage extract and the direct addition of mucilage to the polymer matrix was discussed. The FTIR analysis revealed that both biofilms possessed a similar chemical structure. The thermal behaviour of the two kinds of films resulted very similar with an initial thermal decomposition temperature around at 156 °C. Optical and SEM microscopies showed that the total solids present in the directly-added mucilage formed microphases in the bulk of the films. The mechanical properties disclosed that the higher the content of plasticisers the lower the elastic modulus and hardness values when mucilage was added directly.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/760/268

The results demonstrated the protective effect of immobilization support in all experiments, compared to the free bacteria (p<0.05). The greater viability was observed in immobilized bacterial cells in the presence of breakfast model (14.7%), on the other hand greater viability loss of B. bifidum caused by beer and chili (0% after 30 min simulation) was observed.

The film degradation was monitored by changes in surface morphology, crystallinity, thermal properties and surface wettability. In the first two days, the hydrolysis showed low advance to subsequently exhibit a huge increase of the reaction rate. It suggested that surface erosion is the main mechanism involved in the film degradation. XRD showed the presence of poly-1,3-propanediol, attributed to condensation reaction of plasticizer in acidic conditions. Thermal analysis showed two endothermic peaks at 110-120 oC attributed to melting of crystallized amylopectin and to a lesser extent co-crystallized amylose and amylopectin. The temperature of these peaks was not aected by hydrolysis time, supporting the idea that hydrolysis reactions are constrained to the film surface. Contact angle measurements indicated a significant decrease of hydrophobicity caused by fractionation of starch chains.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/764/271

The storage of chickpea can develop a hardening phenomenon known as hard-to-cook (HTC), which negatively increases technological parameters such as cooking time (CT) and decrease its nutritional and sensory attributes. The aim of this work was to study the rehydration parameters of 18 chickpea genotypes grown in 4 planting locations of Mexico’s Northwest: Culiacan, Los Mochis, Hermosillo and Cd. Obregon, by using a new development of Peleg’s model and to evaluate the effect of genotype, planting location and its interaction on rehydration kinetic parameters. Results showed that low water absorption capacity (WAC) and high CT (p <0.05) were associated to HTC chickpea seeds. Also, experimental data of fresh and HTC chickpea had a good fit to Peleg´s model (R2 = 0.955 - 0.995) and allowed to predict rehydration kinetic parameters (maximum water absorption capacity (WAC)max, water absorption constant (K), maximum velocity of water absorption (Vmax) and time to reach the half of maximum WAC (t1=2W)). The interaction: genotype/planting location affected (p <0.05) the rehydration parameters.

The rheology of five different formulations was determined before microfluidization, while particle size was determined after such processing stage. After freezedrying, it was determined the encapsulation effciency (%EE), also the microcapsules were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The Herschel-Bulkley and Ostwald-deWaele models were found to adequately describe the rheology of formulations so that the consistency coeffcient increased with content of MD10. The particle size was markedly lowest for the formulation containing only MD10; this formulation presented a semi-crystalline X-ray pattern while formulations containing MD20 indicated an amorphous pattern and glass transition temperature in the order of 65 °C. MD20-MD10 mixtures 90:10 and 95:05 reported the highest %EE after one microfluidization cycle.

For this, three materials were analyzed: a sucrose-calcium powder (SA), vibro-fluidized drying pineapple powder (VFD) and capsules of paprika oleoresin in an alginate-zeolite matrix (NE) were analyzed. The three stability criteria showed that the maximum stability was similar to 4.9, 19.9 and 7.3 g water/100 dry solids for SA, VFD and NE, respectively. The results showed that the maximum in the graphical relationship of aW=M vs M, as well as the intercept of the local Rockland isotherms and the cluster function, indicated the equilibrium between the entropic and enthalpic mechanisms of water adsorption, which agrees with the minimum integral entropy and can be used as a criterion to select the best storage conditions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/817/283

Microfluidization showed a significant effect (p ≤ 0.05) in the reduction of Emulsion Droplet Size (EDS) (262-721 nm). Emulsions with higher contents of gum arabic produce the smallest EDS (383-721 nm). EDS and the polydispersity index were directly related while stability and lightness were inversely related to EDS. The majority changes in the stability of emulsions were observed during the first 10 days, promoting the broke up for those emulsions with higher content of maltodextrin. Emulsions with large content of gum arabic remain stable for longer time, despite depletion flocculation due to excess biopolymer.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/824/287

The techniques employed for catalyst characterization were elemental analysis, X-raydiﬀraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermic gravimetric and diﬀerential thermic analyses, and speciﬁc surface area analysis. Also, with the aim of evaluate the deactivation degree in the catalyst; the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulﬁde at diﬀerent temperatures was performed. Additionally, spent catalyst samples with diﬀerent sulfate content were analyzed. The catalyst presented a high degree of thermic degradation, which led to a considerable loss of speciﬁc surface area and crystalline phase transition. The sulfates in the TiO2 catalyst increases the selectivity and reaction yield, and provides stability to the catalyst.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/854/299

For this purpose, a thermodynamic study was made of the recirculation effects over: a) the ratio of reforming agents/methane, b) the outlet/inlet atomic hydrogen ratio (ψ), c) the reactor relative size, and d) the normalized electric energy output. The results show that in order to avoid coking, a steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) higher than 2 is unnecessary, for a combined reforming with steam and CO2. Moreover, it was found that ψ is maximized at a recirculation ratio of 0.22; and that an increase of recirculation caused a decrease in the electrical energy produced, and an increase in the relative reactor volume. Finally, it was found that a recirculation ratio of 0.22 was the best option for an operating temperature of 850°C. If the recirculation ratio is exceeded to achieve S/C= 2, the hydrogen fraction produced will decrease 50% and the reactor volume will increase 118% for the same amount of biogas fed",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/855/300

The NMs life cycle includes the analysis of how they may enter the environment and cause adverse eﬀects. From this point of view, NMs can be viewed as nanopollutans. This review presents a summary of the most relevant information on NMs production, their transport on the environment, incidence in residual eﬄuents and their eﬀect on aerobic bioreactors for wastewater treatment. As shown in the present analysis, the presence of nanopollutans in aerobic bioreactors has negative eﬀects in the removal of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorous. This occurs mainly because of the internalization of nanopollutans in microorganisms, the gravitational settling, agglomeration and partial dissolution of nanopollutans. These processes indicated that the main output of nanopollutants from aerobic bioreactors is the sludge disposal",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/858/301

The BET surface area of the Zea mays material was 1.25  0±.01 m2g1, with an average pore size of 4.71 nm. Experimental data show a 100% of Cr(VI) is removed in a period of 4 hours at pH between 1 and 3. A pH value of 3 was chosen for the adsorption studies, with a maximum adsorption capacity of2mg g1and a Cr(VI) adsorption percentage onto ZMR of 98.6%. The Freundlich model represented the equilibrium of the adsorption process better than Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetics of Cr(VI) onto ZMR were well defined using the pseudo-second order model. The results showed that ZMR is a potential biomaterial for Cr(VI) removal and pH has an important effect on metal adsorption capacity. The Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) was observed during the adsorption process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/865/302

The main characteristic of these cookers is the use of revolution-type Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CPC). The implementation and monitoring were conducted in an indigenous community Santa Fe de la Laguna, Municipio de Quiroga, of Michoac´an, Mexico. Standardized solar cooking tests were carried out with three to select the best thermic and ergonomic properties. Prior to implementation, the team conducted a survey of available forest resources, organized training workshops, and drafted a user?s manual for construction and maintenance of the cooker in the indigenous language (Pur´epecha) and Spanish. The objectives of using this solar cooker are to reduce consumption of firewood, the fuel generally used in food preparation, by up to 30%, promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES), mitigate respiratory diseases caused by inhalation of woodsmoke and contribute to economic savings in the households that.

An option of treatment is combining anaerobic digestion and denitrification process in a single unit. During this research, an anaerobic expanded bed reactor was operated at different C/N ratios (10, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1) in order to study nitrogen and organic matter removal. A 3 L reactor was used with a flow feed of 3 L/d, upflow velocity of 7 m/h and temperature between 30-35°C. Organic matter removal remained above 90% throughout the 177 days of experimentation. Nitrogen removal was over 90%, when C/N ratios were greater than the stoichiometric (C/N>1), however, with a ratio C/N=1, nitrogen removal was 60%, causing the accumulation of nitrite. The high removal of nitrate and organic matter reached in this study demonstrate the viability to use this type of reactors for the treatment of such effluents, in spite of the fact that the increase of nitrate concentration changed the biomass distribution, which caused a decrease in the size of anaerobic granules.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/915/318

Due that records are available at discrete time periods, the most common way to examine the data is through the application of statistical methods in the time domain. These methods can be classified based on their usefulness in those which seek to quantify the magnitude of the corrosion process (standard deviations), highlighting the use of noise and resistance in trying to extract information about the mechanism of the corrosion process itself, based on the assumption that the shape of the temporary registers are a reflection of the behavior of the metal - electrolyte interface. Among these is possible to mention the average value, the bias, the kurtosis, and pitting index, which may reflect changes in the corrosion mechanism. This paper presents the statistical treatment of the data obtained from specimens with RE steel embedded in concrete made with NaCl ( Cl ), NaCl + NaNO2 ( I) without addition of NaCl ( S ) in the mixing water and exposed to an average natural marine",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/887/307

Four gelatin film forming solutions (GFFS) with SDS concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.6 and 1.1g/100g gelatin, containing 0.1g of MWCNT /100g gelatin, were subjected to dynamic rheology. These GFFS were used for film obtainment, to which mechanical, optical, structural (diffractometry) and thermal (thermogravimetry) analysis were determined. The surfactant effect of SDS, was better at the critical micelle concentration of 1.1g/100g gelatin, causing the best MWCNT dispersion and highest elastic modulus (G’) in GFFS. Both the control and sample 0.1GFFS, at frequencies lower than 5 rad/s, behaved as mainly dilute solutions (G” > G’) at 25°C, while samples 0.6GFFS and 1.1GFFS, displayed physical gel properties (G’ > G”) at the same temperature. At 10°C, all GFFS showed typical viscoelastic gel-like behavior. Thermogravimetry and diffractometry showed re-ordering on gelatin triple helix, when the MWCNT dispersion increased. The SDS critical micellar concentration increased 60.66% the elongation at break of films. The optical photomicrographs showed an improved homogeneous distribution of the MWCNT, as the SDS concentration increased.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/892/308
