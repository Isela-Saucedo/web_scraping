Three different mass flow recirculation rates in the reactor are compared to assess the impact of interfacial mass transfer on the sodium acetate consumption. The system used was a single-tube membrane attached biofilm reactor, connected to a reservoir with the model waste water. The substrate and oxygen dissolved concentrations in the liquid, were measure at the exit of the reactor. The decreases of substrate and oxygen concentration were measured along batch operation, using different recirculation flow rates. A dynamic model was employed to predict the observed evolution of substrate and oxygen dissolved in the tank. The model accounts for the counter-diffusion of substrate and oxygen as well as for the bioreaction within the biofilm, and the external mass transfer. The interfacial mass transport coefficients were estimated specifically for each one of the different flow rates used and they were compared to those calculated from the Blasius’ solution to the boundary layer equations. The model successfully predicted concentration measurements for the different sets ofexperiments, and it was able to predict the concentration profiles and reaction profiles inside the biofilm.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1822/917

MixW were added with several sugar cane molasses concentrations as the carbon source, 180 g.kg-1 of sugar molasses gave the fastest acidification. The maximum concentration of lactic acid (Pmax) was significantly higher with Lactobacillus sp. B2 than that obtained with Lb. plantarum. MixW was selected for scaling up and inoculated with Lactobacillus sp. B2 due to the enhanced lactic acid production and availability. According to microbiological and chemical analyses, the fermented product was well preserved due to the acid produced and the reduction in aW (0.94) that inhibit spoilage microorganisms and putrefaction. The coefficient of protein hydrolysis at 144 h of fermentation was significantly higher (0.94) than the obtained with raw MixW (0.12). The coefficient of protein in vitro digestibility (CPD) was also determined, which was higher, 0.88, than raw MixW (0.69).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1823/918

The advantages that microdevices offer are shorter time and lower reagent consumption. The advances in microfluidics, the science that studies the handling of fluids on microscale (10−9 to 10−18 liters), have allowed the development of microdevices with applications in bioseparations. Chromatography, electrophoresis y dielectrophoresis are the bioseparation techniques more applicable on microscale, these techniques have been successfully utilized for the separation and concentration of a wide variety of bioparticles, ranging from proteins to parasites. The present paper presents an analysis of the advances in the field of microscale bioseparations, i.e. the application of microfluidics in bioseparations, the objective is to provide the reader with information on the state of the art in this field. Furthermore, an overview of the development of this research field in Mexico is presented, where information about the mexican researchers and institutions working in this field is included.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1824/920

The cultures used were Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium spp., and nine substrates divided in rich in fiber, starch and protein. Cellulose, amylase and protease profiles were obtained. Results showed that all of the cultures were different (P<0.05) in comparison with the control (without added fungal culture) in the in vitro assays with all the substrates. No correlations were observed between the enzymatic activities and the increase in the disappearance of dry matter. In the orthogonal contrasts, the Aspergillus genre had a higher influence (P<0.001) than the other fungal genre in the substrates rich in fiber and protein. In the substrates rich in starch non-significant differences (P>0.05) were observed among the cultures, although only two Aspergillus cultures included amylases. The results suggest that the increase in the disappearance of dry matter cannot be attributed to the addition of fungal cultures only the enzymatic activity, but those other mechanisms are involved, and that the effect is more substrate dependent and not of fungal culture type.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1826/921

SALADETTE TOMATOES (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) STORED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS,"The objectives of this study were to determine the concentration of lycopene in cv. Saladette tomato subjected to blanching (thermal treatment), to extract the carotenoid and to evaluate the stability of the pigment in solutions added with and without antioxidants, in conditions of darkness at 4, 20 and 60 °C, and in fluorescent light at 20 °C during 30 days. The concentration of lycopene in non blanched tomatoes was 79.20 μg/g, while in blanched tomatoes it was 75.25 μg/g, none presenting any significant difference. The degradation of lycopene in solution during storage in darkness, fluorescent light or different temperatures, followed a reaction of the first order. In conditions of darkened or lightened storing at 20 °C, the retention of the carotenoid in both experiments was greater for solutions containing lycopene extracted from blanched tomatoes than for solutions with pigment extracted from unblanched tomatoes after 30 days. When the pigment in solution with antioxidants added was stored at different temperatures, the greatest lycopene retention was in darkness at 4 °C. In contrast, pigment degradation was greater in conditions of light and 20 °C, than in darkness at 60 °C. The constant rate of lycopene degradation increased when elevating temperature",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1850/934

Film mechanical properties were determined with a TA-XT2 texture analyzer. Films with greater breaking factor, tensile strength, tensile strength at break, and tensile energy at break were obtained when sodium alginate was used alone. Low Young’s modulus values were obtained with blends of sodium alginate and κ-carrageenan (with the latter predominating in the blend) and mesquite gum-whey protein concentrate (with the former predominating in the blend). The latter blend exhibited highest elongation. Films containing pure sodium alginate or κ-carrageenan or blended with the other gums (with sodium alginate predominating) could be classified as hard, strong and resistant. Films where mesquite gum or whey protein concentrates were on their or where their blend predominated over that of sodium alginate and/or κ-carragenan were mostly soft and weak.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1851/935

ACTIVATION ENERGY DETERMINATION,"Native banana (Musa paradisiaca L.) starch was subjected to oxidation with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) at 2 % of active chlorine (p/v) at different temperatures (30, 40 and 50 ºC) and two pH (7.0 and 8.5). The rate constants (k) and the activation energy (Ea) were obtained from the concentration of hypochlorite ClO−, (expressed as chlorine consumption) during the starch oxidation. First and second order equations were used to determine the reaction order, considering the initial concentrations of the starch [A]0 = 2.134 moles/L and the oxidant agent [B]0= 140.84 mmoles/L. As the temperature increased and at 40 minutes of reaction, practically all chlorine was consumed and in major amount at pH 8.5, obtaining values near to 20 mg Cl2 / g of starch. More than 75 % of chlorine reacted during the five minutes, presumably with the starch pigments. The data were fit for a first order reaction and the reaction rate was higher at pH 7.0 than at 8.5, and it increased when temperature increased. The results allowed the calculation of the Ea of 66.481 KJ/mol (pH 8.5) and 51.082 KJ/mol (pH 7.0).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1854/942

The degree of substitution (DS) rose with the reaction time and consequently the reaction efficiency increased. The reaction rate constant was higher in plantain (0.67 h-1) starch than in maize starch (0.23 h-1). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the introduction of acetyl groups in the starch molecule and the signal characteristic of this group (1226 cm-1) was higher at longer reaction times. The starch granule surface, observed by scanning electron microscopy, showed more changes when the reaction time increased and those were minimal in plantain starch. This pattern agreed with the higher crystallinity peaks measured by X-ray diffraction in plantain starch and an amorphous pattern obtained in acetylated maize starch. Peak temperature (74.8 ºC for native plantain starch and 71 ºC for its acetylated counterpart) and enthalpy of gelatinization (12.89 J/g for native plantain starch and 7.44 J/g for its acetylated counterpart) decreased in the acetylated starches and the effect was higher at longer reaction times. It is possible to determine a reaction time in order to obtain an acetylated plantain starch with specific DS and physicochemical and functional properties",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1855/945

The performance of a hexagonal feldspar packing was evaluated in an aerated biological pilot reactor. The feldspar packing was obtained by direct extrusion followed by sintering at 1100°C, during 4 hours, conditions at which the highest porosity and specific surface area were obtained. In addition to its easy preparation and low cost, the packing presented chemical resistance to different acids. The biological fixed bed up flow reactor with a total volume of 30.7 L was randomly packed with the hexagonal pieces of feldspar. Dispersion test were performed with a tracer (KCl), to estimate the dispersion number (Nd) in the reactor, with and without aeration. It was found that the dispersion increased due to the aeration and exerts a strong influence on reactor performance. A plug flow reactor model with axial dispersion and Monod kinetic was used to describe the carbon removal (COD) in the reactor at different hydraulic loading rates. The wastewater used during the tests was sampled at the exit of the primary settler of a Mexican wastewater treatment plant, being a mixture of industrial and urban effluents, with a COD = 650 mg/L. Four ascendant flow hydraulic loadings (L) from 1.08 x 10−4 (m3/s m2) to 4.32 x 10−4 (m3/s m2) were tested. The COD removal was about 95%, higher than the 85% reported in other studies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1827/922

Ammonia is known as an important disinfectant capable to significantly inactivate high microbial populations in sludge. In this study, the effect of ammonia was evaluated in agro industrial physicochemical sludge and kinetic parameters of the Hom model were used to describe the inactivation of bacteria at different total solids concentrations. Raw physicochemical sludge with 2.0 ± 0.5% TS were sampled from a bird slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plant. Ammonia in doses from 1 to 40% w/w was directly applied to dehydrated sludge (4, 8 and 12% TS). After 2h, samples were taken for microbial analyses. Results showed that the ammonia removed 9 and 6.5 logs of fecal coliforms and Salmonella spp., respectively, making possible to meet the US EPA limits for Class A biosolids. The analysis of parameters k, n and m of the Hom model, indicates higher resistance to inactivation of bacteria when lower is the total solids concentration, due mainly to the ammonia dilution in the water. Also, 75% less ammonia was needed to meet the US EPA standard when sludge was dewatered.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1828/923

The overall goal of this study was to determine the variation of nutrient concentrations in the water column in open-ocean floating cages with cultures of Lutjanus peru (Pacific red snapper) and L. guttatus (spotted rose snapper). Nutrient concentration (ammonia-N, nitrite-N, nitrate-N, and phosphate) were evaluated every fifteen days in the water column at three stations (cages) and two depths; likewise, several water quality parameters were analyzed daily (water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and Secchi disk). Analyses of water in general showed that no significant differences existed between the monthly concentration of nutrients from the control stations and depths. Nitrate was the nutrient with the highest concentration (2.83 to 3.56 mg/L); however, these values were relatively low and normal for these waters. The results show that when working with fish densities of 2500 to 3500 fish/cage and small quantities of food (60 ton/year) no impact is made on the water column quality in the floating cages culture system",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1830/924

In addition, seeds and seedlings at different growth stages were treated with 40 mg kg−1 Cr(III) to determine the effect of plant age on the tolerance to these treatments. It was found that the younger the plant, the higher the resistance to Cr(III). Consequently, H. annuus seeds were sown on (a) nutrient solution without Cr(III) (Control I); (b) nutrient solution without Cr(III) + 0.8 mM EDDS (Control II); (c) nutrient solution with 40 mg L−1 Cr(III); (d) nutrient solution with 40 mg L−1 Cr(III) + 0.8 mM EDDS. It was found that, after 15 days following germination, roots were able to accumulate 7,400 y 710 mg Cr kg−1, whereas shoots accumulated 200 y 32 mg Cr kg−1 (dry weigth), for Cr y Cr- SS-EDDS treatments, respectively. Therefore, the presence of SS-EDDS reduced Cr(III) absorption and traslocation. These results indicated that H. annuus does not need the presence of SS-EDDS to absorb significant amounts of Cr(III); this might reduced the costs associated to the phytoremediation of Cr(III) contaminated media using this plant species",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1831/925

The relative concentrations between the polysaccharides in these two phases, is difficult to quantify. In this work, the equilibrium phase was subjected to acid hydrolysis, and evaluation of the produced monosaccharides was done by HPLC. Composition of the coacervate phase was computed by mass balance. These results were compared with those obtained previously for the same system, where the coacervate phase was analyzed by elementary analysis. Results obtained using both procedures were non-significantly different",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1857/946

Therefore β-chitin is more soluble in common solvents as well as it display higher reactivity for deacetylation and chemical modification than α-chitin. Preparation of β-chitin was carried out by chemical method that involved demineralization (DM) with HCl, followed by deproteinization (DP) with NaOH. Dosidicus gigas pen was used in several particle sizes. Distilled or tap water were used for all the processes and their effect was compared on the basis of products qualities. Protein was fully removed from squid pen by using NaOH concentration of 2M at 25ºC. Particle size was a significant factor for DM, however it was non significant for DP. The yields of β-chitin and chitosan obtained were 32% and 20% and water expenses were 0.3 L/g and 2.8 L/g, respectively. The chitosan produced was highly soluble in acidic water (95%) with molecular weight (Mv) of 534.17 g/mol and degree of acetylation of 26%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1859/950

However, due to numerous industrial applications for chemical tubular reactors, the problem of monitoring and controlling them effectively is of great safety and economical importance. In this work, we introduce a new cascade control scheme based on three-temperature measurement distributed along the axial position of the tubular reactor with respect to a weighted average temperature (wav). The control configuration exploits the information provided by two additional temperatures sensor located at the feed and the output of the tubular reactor. The configuration with wav improves the behavior of the control scheme by enhancing the disturbance and parameter’s uncertainty. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate and compare the controlperformance.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1860/952
