Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Petrography, geochemistry and geochronology of the orogenic magmatism in Rayón: petrological characteristics of the last subduction-related magmas in Sonora, Mexico","Neogene magmatism associated to the subduction of the Farallon plate is widely distributed in a NW-SE belt in northwestern Mexico. In Sonora, this magmatism is commonly intercalated with clastic units, and presents calc-alkaline, high-potassium calc-alkaline and shoshonitic affinity. The orogenic magmatism in the region of Rayon is covered by anorogenic pyroclastic deposits related to the proto-Gulf of California and is divided into two stages: early Miocene volcanism (16.51 ± 0.64 Ma) followed by a middle Miocene event (14.88 ± 0.47 Ma). Both rock sequences occur as lavas, domes and volcanic necks, which were affected by a Miocene extensional tectonic regime. Field, petrographic and geochemical characteristics differentiate two sequences: 1) Cerro Prieto volcanic member, composed of vitreous, porphyric, two pyroxenes and olivine andesitic lavas, and 2) Las Agujas Volcanic Complex, consisting of hypabyssal rocks, domes and dacitic lavas with two pyroxenes and amphibole. Geochemically, rocks of both units are calc-alkaline, are enriched in light rare earth elements, and display a pronounced fractionation of the heavy rare earth elements, low Y and Yb concentrations, and high Sr content, which is more prominent in the younger unit. These orogenic magmatic episodes are related to the latest manifestations of the continental arc in Sonora; the adakitic affinity could be related to a particular configuration of the slab in the final stage of the microplate subduction.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/577/447
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Structural analysis of the La Colorada Mine, Sonora, Mexico","La Colorada Mine is an important gold and silver deposit located in the Sonora state, NW Mexico. Mineralization consists of quartz veins containing carbonates, sulphides, with silver and gold ore. The veins were emplaced along normal faults and related breccia zones. Our structural study recognizes one folding phase imposed on Paleozoic to Mesozoic (?) sedimentary rocks, which is ascribed to the Late Cretaceous Laramide Orogeny based on the orientation of the structures and the age of the units. Four sets of normal faults were recognized and its relative age defined based on crosscutting relationships, stratigraphy, rock ages, contacts, and structural analyses. The first set strikes ENE-WSW to E-W and dips both N and S. Faults of this set host the main mineralized veins, which have been dated between 27 and 22 Ma. The second set consists of NW-SE striking faults, with SW and NE dip. Similarly oriented structures occur in the Basin and Range physiographic province, which has been dated in Sonora between ~26 and 15 Ma. The third set is represented by a NE-SW striking conjugate fault system, which predates or is coeval to a widespread peralkaline ignimbrite dated at 12.3 Ma. The fourth set of conjugate faults strikes NNW-SSE and may have been active from 10 Ma to the present. These mid-late Tertiary fault sets suggest that changes in the stress field occurred from the final phase of subduction until the present.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/578/448
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks hosting the Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous San Nicolás VMS deposit, southern Zacatecas, Mexico","San Nicolás is a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, stratiform Zn- Cu-Ag-Au volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit located in central Mexico, with a total resource of 99 Mt of ore grading 1.36 % Cu, 1.64 % Zn, 0.41 g/t Au and 24 g/t Ag. At San Nicolás mining district the ore deposits are related with submarine graben-horst structures produced by the opening of the Gulf of México. San Nicolás VMS deposit is at the right side of a graben structure, fed through a normal growing fault called ""La Panza"". The host-rock succession consists of a variably altered rhyolite lava dome in the hanging wall and a basalt- dacite-dominated volcano-sedimentary sequence in the footwall. The sulfide deposit and hosting volcanic sequence were metamorphosed under lower greenschist facies. A laterally continuous footwall alteration zone extends beneath the entire district (~80 km2) and to a stratigraphic level at least 200 m below the several ore lenses. The bulk of this zone is occupied by feldspar-destructive, muscovite-biotite-chlorite-rich, mottled alteration facies with disseminated pyrite. The ore mineralization was controlled by a fault zone with intense quartz-pyrite alteration and represents the principal fluid pathway during mineralizing hydrothermal activity. Locally, quartz-K feldspar alteration facies occur on the edges of the system, whereas calcareous alteration and chlorite- pyrite alteration facies occur in the upper part of footwall volcanics, next to sulfide lenses. Porphyritic basalts, plus basaltic pillow lavas and volcanic breccias in the hanging wall are unaltered or weakly altered. Carbonate alteration (formation of dolomite and/or ankerite) probably represents the initial phase of hydrothermal activity. This was followed by diffuse upwelling of acidic hydrothermal fluids causing dissolution of underlying limestones and destruction of primary feldspars, precipitation of pyrite, and formation of sericite, chlorite, and clay minerals. Subsequently, intense quartz- pyrite alteration was directly associated with mineralization. The San Nicolás footwall alteration zone shows systematic geochemical changes with increasing proximity to the ore bodies. These include Na depletion and elevated Mg, S, AI (AI=100*[MgO+K2O]/ [MgO+K2O+Na2O+CaO]), CCPI(CCPI=100*[MgO+FeO]/ [MgO+FeO+Na2O+K2O]),as well as Mo, Bi, and As. These geochemical features can be used in exploration for massive sulfide deposits as guides to ore, at the district scale, and in discrimination of prospective hydrothermal from unprospective diagenetic alteration systems at the regional scale.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/579/450
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Paleoenvironment of the Central Depression of Chiapas, based on stable carbon and oxygen isotopes","We inferred the diet ofEquus conversidens(three specimens),Cuvieronius hyodon(five specimens),Bison sp.,Eremotherium laurillardi,Mammuthus columbiandPanthera atrox(one specimen each) from Rancholabrean fluvio-lacustrine deposits in the Central Depression of Chiapas, using their carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. The environmental conditions prevailing during the Late Pleistocene in the region were also inferred. Our analysis shows that E. conversidens, Bison sp., and M. columbi fed on C4 plants (δ13C: -1.8‰ to -1.0‰), E. laurillardi was a mixer feeder C3/C4 (δ13C: -7.7‰); on the other hand C. hyodon was a largely a C3 plants feeder (δ13C: -9.4‰ to 11.4‰), whereas P. atrox preyed upon C4 herbivores (δ13C: -5.5‰). Our analysis also discloses more arid climate than at present, as well as the presence of grasslands associated to trees.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/580/452

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Fossil-diagenetic modifications in Toxodon platensis Owen, 1837 (Notoungulata, Toxodontidae) from the Late Pleistocene of Corrientes Province, Argentina","Fossil-diagenetic features, including mineralogical, geochemical and paleohistological aspects, present in ribs ofToxodon platensisOwen (Mammalia, Notoungulata, Toxodontidae) were analyzed. Remains were recovered from floodplain deposits of the Toropí/Yupoí Formation assigned to the Late Pleistocene, cropping out in Corrientes Province (Mesopotamian Region, Argentina). The main mineral components of the ribs include hydroxyapatite and dahllite. The black color identified on the outer surface of some remains is related to impregnations due to precipitation of iron oxides. Original bone microstructure shows good preservation, but numerous radial microcracks were identified in the secondary osteons of all specimens. Iron oxides fill most microstructural features (Havers and Volkmann canals, osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi) and radial microcracks, and also replaced diverse areas of the bone matrix. The obtained information allows interpreting that the taphonomic histories of these remains are closely related to the particular characteristics of the environment of preservation.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/582/453
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Kimmeridgian pliosaurids (Sauropterygia, Plesiosauria) from Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, southern Mexico","Fossil remains of two specimens of the family Pliosauridae are described in the present manuscript. These fossils are from the Kimmeridgian shallow marine strata belonging to the informally known Sabinal formation deposited in the Tlaxiaco Basin, which are exposed in Yosobé, near Tlaxiaco town, Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. The first of these specimens consists of a fragment of premaxilla with teeth, which show diagnostic characters that allow its taxonomical identification as member of the genusLiopleurodon. The second specimen is preserved by a significantly higher number of bone elements; however, this is only identified as a member of the family Pliosauridae. Despite the shortage of the pliosaurs fossil record so far recovered in Yosobé, the specimens described here significantly contribute to the knowledge of this extinct group. On the one hand, these Kimmeridgian fossils are the southernmost representatives of these reptiles discovered in North America and the first collected in deposits of the Hispanic Corridor. On the other hand, the presence of the genusLiopleurodonin this fossil locality confirms its biogeographical distribution into the western domain of the Tethys Sea, beyond Europe.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/583/454
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"K-Ar illite-mica age constraints on the formation and reactivation history of the El Doctor fault zone, central Mexico","The tectonic history of the Mexican Fold and Thrust Belt exposed in the Sierra Madre Oriental can be assessed in detail by dating the activation of the major shortening structures. The aim of this paper is to present mineralogical and K-Ar geochronologic data of illite-mica from the El Doctor thrust fault, a kilometer-scale structure exposed in the central-western Mexican Fold and Thrust Belt. Such a structure is a brittle-ductile shear zone characterized by subgreenschists facies peak conditions. The crystallization ages of neoformed clay-micaceous minerals from the core of this shear zone are used to constrain the tectonic activity along the selected shear zone. A total of 17 lutite samples were collected from different structural levels of the shear zone. The samples were characterized petrographically and detailed mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction. Grain-size subfractions were separated from 11 selected samples, which were subsequently used for K-Ar dating. The mesostructural and microstructural analyses, supported by K-Ar geochronologic data, permitted reconstruct of the crystallization history of phyllosilicate phases related to the tectonic activity of the shear zone. Our data indicate that the El Doctor thrust fault records a complex structural evolution, which is represented by at least three superposed deformation phases. The first phase consists of the shear zone activation, which produced a main foliation pervasive at the submillimeter-scale defined by neoformed illite-mica. This phase is constrained at 80–75 Ma, which is the range of K-Ar ages obtained by illite-mica from the coarse-grained subfractions collected at the core of the shear zone. Subsequent tectonic phases produced the reactivation of the El Doctor shear zone, which produced folding and crenulation of the previous foliation, successively cut by meter- scale extensional shear bends. The most recent reactivation phases, including diagenesis, are constrained to an age of 50–40 Ma obtained from the finest illite subfractions. Based on our data, we conclude that the El Doctor thrust fault recorded a complex, multi-phase structural evolution, characterized by a phase of activation during the Campanian period, and at least one post-Cretaceous reactivation event. The whole history of orogenic wedge construction is preserved in the El Doctor fault.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/584/455
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Isotope geochronology and vertebrate paleontology in Mexico: Panorama and critical appraisal,"The combined isotopic/paleontologic approach drove a qualitative leap in understanding Earth’s geologic history/evolution, yet, in spite of its early start, it is still not widely used in México. Here we report 28 sites where such an approach was applied; their space/time distribution is uneven, leaving morphotectonic provinces and/or geochronologic intervals little or not studied at all. The sites are located in eight morphotectonic provinces, their age spans the Jurassic-Pliocene as follows: Baja California Península (BCP), one Cretaceous and one Miocene site. Northwestern Ranges, Basins and Plains (NW), one Miocene site. Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOc), four Miocene sites. Central Plateau (CeP), one Late Eocene and eight Miocene/Pliocene sites. Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOr), one Jurassic and one Miocene sites. Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), two Miocene and three Pliocene sites. Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS), one Eocene and three Miocene sites. Sierra Madre de Chiapas (SMCh), one Miocene site. The Chihuahua-Coahuila sierras, basins and plateaus, Gulf Coastal Plain and Yucatan Platform lack such sites.The Pliensbachian Huizachal site (SMOr) lies in the rift system that split central-eastern Pangea and contains Mexico’s oldest vertebrate fauna. The Late Campanian El Rosario site (BCP) is located in the namesake Forearc Basin, its fauna shows moderate endemism. The Cenozoic sites lie in graben structures and record episodes of tectonic and magmatic activity. The Eocene Marfil (CeP) and Yolomécatl (SMS) sites occur in post-Laramide basins, their Bridgerian and Duchesnian/ Chadronian faunas show boreal affinities and strong endemism. The Early Miocene Tubutama (NW) and Suchilquitongo (SMS) sites record tectonic/magmatic activity around 20 Ma, and their faunas display North American affinities and moderate endemism.The Middle Miocene La Purísima (BCP), Matatlán (SMS), El Camarón (SMS) and Ixtapa (SMCh) sites record tectonic and magmatic activitycirca15 Ma; the three latter ones disclose a volcanic belt extending from central Oaxaca to northern Chiapas; their faunas show North American affinities and evidence local cladogenesis. The Late Miocene Paso del Águila (SMOr), El Resbalón, Cofradía, Tepezalá, El Trapiche (SMOc), Rancho El Ocote (CeP) and Tecolotlán (TMVB) sites record tectonic/magmatic activity between 9.5 and 5.0 Ma; their mammals involve Late Clarendonian-Early Hemphillian and Hemphillian chronofaunas. The younger fauna reveals an early appearance of South American taxa in North America. The important Chapala site (TMVB) still lacks isotopic ages associated to Late Tertiary vertebrates.The pliocene GTO 43, Rancho El Ocote, GTO 2D, Garbani, GTO 11, Pantera, GTO 12B, Estancia, GTO 5A, Rancho El Ocote, GTO 55 sites (CeP), Santa María Amajac, Charo and Buenaventura sites (TMVB) record a 4.5–3.5 Ma tectonic/volcanic activity; their Blancan chronofauna includes numerous South American taxa, disclosing that the Great American Biotic Interchange reached its peak. These sites/ sequences also carry Late Hemphillian taxa, thus allowing studying mammalian succession and turnover in central Mexico.Finally, in the 27 reported sites with isotopic ages and studied Cretaceous-Tertiary vertebrates, the North American Land Mammal Age System is proven supporting the uncritical belief that it is appropriate to date faunas from Mexico, in spite that this system is based on mammal faunas from temperate/cold North America.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/585/456
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Palaeoenvironmental, palaeoecological and palaeobiogeographical implications of mixed fresh water and brackish marine assemblages from the Cretaceous-Palaeogene Deccan intertrappean beds at Jhilmili, Chhindwara District, central India","The Deccan infra- and intertrappeans volcano-sedimentary sequences have been considered as terrestrial to fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Presence of planktonic foraminifera and brackish water ostracods in the Jhilmili basal Danian intertrappean beds, recorded earlier, indicates complex palaeoenvironment, palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography. The intertrappean sediments span 14 m between two Deccan basaltic flows deposited under terrestrial, palustrine and flood plain environments. In the middle of this section is a 60 cm- thick layer (unit 3) that contains fresh water ostracods, charophytes and Early Danian planktonic foraminifera. Palaeoecologically, the ostracod assemblage includes active swimmers (Cypridopsis,Cypria,Mongolianella,ParacyprettaandZonocypris) and poor swimmers (Limnocythere,Gomphocythere,FrambocythereandDarwinula). The bulk of the ostracod fauna points to a freshwater, lacustrine depositional environment. Presence of planktonic foraminifera and two brackish water ostracod species (Buntoniasp. andNeocyprideis raoi) invigorates discussion of a marine seaway into central India, with this fauna carried through the Narmada and Tapti rift zones by seasonal offshore currents (short lived transgressive phase), which created temporary estuarine conditions and deposited marine micro-biota. Above this interval, sediments in unit 4 and 5 consist of reddish and greenish grey clayey siltstone with rare fine sand layers deposited in palustrine and terrestrial conditions. The ostracod fauna shows extensive endemism which come across among the Indian Maastrichtian non-marine ostracods sustained into the Early Danian, which further proposed geographically isolated Indian plate and intercontinental dispersal of Maastrichtian to early Danian freshwater ostracods that support the Out-of-India hypothesis. Age of the Jhilmili intertrappean beds is Early Danian-Maastrichtian based on planktonic foraminifera and few brackish water ostracods.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/586/457
