The adsorptive capacity (mg Atrazina /g of biomass) of each species was S. lancifolia (qm= 2.035), followed by T. domingensis (qm= 1.797), and E. pyramidalis (qm= 1.107). The highest adsorptive capacity of S. lancifolia is related to the elevated lipid content, which could interact with the herbicide. These results provide information about adsorption as a promissory technique to pesticides remediation in flooded areas",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1711/829

Ground meat samples was inoculated with one of the following LAB: Lactobacillus carnis, Lactobacillus pentosus or Staphylococcus carnosus, or mixed with lactic acid; and stored at 4 or 20ºC for 12 or 6 days, respectively. Biogenic amine concentration (histamine, cadaverine, putrescine and tyramine) was analyzed by HPLC. Lactic acid and the inoculated LAB reduced biogenic amine to a concentration lower than 0.25 mg/kg in samples stored at 20ºC; amine concentration in control samples was 4.91 mg/kg. However, LAB failed to reduce cadaverine, putrescine and tyramine concentrations, regardless of storage temperature. Meat samples treated with lactic acid showed the lowest putrescine and tyramine concentrations. This fact allowed concluding that lactic acid is an efficient means to control biogenic amine production in vacuum packaged beef, whereas LAB cannot prevent amine formation. LAB do not control the growth of several spoilage microorganisms and, in consequence, these protective strains do not reduce biogenic amine levels. Therefore, initial microbial meat quality is determinant for biogenic amine production during beef storage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1714/831

In this work the prebiotic component of An that stimulates the growth of a cellulolitic bacterial consortium from ruminal origin (CBCRO) was characterized. Ultrafiltrated fractions of less than 30 kDa, heat treated at 60, 90 and 120 ºC were used. The fractions were obtained by ionexchange chromatography and their average molecular weight was determined by molecular exclusion chromatography. Protein and carbohydrate contents and the infrared spectra were determined on the active fractions. Results showed that all the heat treated ultrafiltrated fractions significantly increased (P<0.05) carboxymethylcellulases’ activities, and protein and acetate productions of the CBCRO. Molecular exclusion chromatography established that the active fraction had a molecular mass of 6.1 kDa, whereas only one active fraction was detected through ion exchange chromatography. Biochemical analysis and infrared spectra data suggest that the prebiotic component of An has a peptidic nature",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1718/835

A novel experimental approach that resulted from the combination of quantitative 2D electrophoresis (2-DE) with hydrophobic partitioning in aqueous twophase systems (ATPS) was applied for the three-dimensional characterization of soybean proteins. The three dimensional scatter plots of molecular weight (MR), isoelectric point (pI) and surface hydrophobicity (log Kp) were obtained using two different ATPS compositions, PEG 3350 (15.7%)-sodium sulfate (8.9%)-NaCl (3%) and PEG 3350 (14.8%)-potassium phosphates (10.3%)-NaCl (3%). Molecular properties of soybean proteins were obtained (MR, pI and log Kp) simultaneously using two different ATPS resulting in two different protein profiles, suggesting a high influence of the phase-forming salt on the partitioning behavior of soybean proteins. The presence of dominant proteins derived from two main storage proteins limited the number of spots detected in gels and consequently the number of 3D spots characterized. The identification of the major contaminants proteins and their relative concentration depicted in the tridimensional graph represents the first stage in the selection of better strategies for the purification of products or the selection of a potential host in the development of bioprocesses",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1719/836

Results from goat milk whey ultrafiltration experiments are presented, from which high protein/lactose ratio protein is recovered. In its lyophilized form, this protein presents superior solubility characteristics with respect to analogous commercial products. The ultrafiltration permeate was utilized as growth culture medium for the probiotic microorganism L. casei. Results from batch and fed-batch fermentation experiments are reported. The growth kinetics of L. casei in de-proteinized goat milk whey is analyzed. From batch experiments, a kinetic characterization is conducted. A strong inhibition of biomass growth by lactic acid production is observed. Fed-batch strategies resulted in higher average productivities, lower residual substrate concentrations, and higher product viable counts than batch strategies",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1720/837

With two modalities: cheeses made from pasteurized milk and cheeses made from raw milk. Samples were taken in January, February, March and April of 2007. The objectives of this research work were: to microbiologically evaluate the tropical cream cheese in finished product form, in function of the presence of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, pathogens such as Salmonella sp. and E. coli; and to determine the physiochemical characteristics of the tropical cream cheese and their influence on the development of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. Microbiological variables were number of fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), E. coli, number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria (MAB) and detection of Salmonella sp. The physiochemical variables were water activity (Aw), pH, total acidity, protein, moisture, fat content, sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium and ashes %. The data were analyzed by univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). The cheese did not meet microbiological standards for FCB, E. coli and Salmonella. The ANOVA showed significant differences (α ≤ 0.05) among the cheeses with respect to the number of fecal coliform bacteria. The number of MAB, (ANOVA) showed no significant differences (α = 0.05) among the five treatments. The canonical discriminate analysis (CDA) showed that the tropical cream cheeses presented differences in their physiochemical and microbiological characteristics,depending on the different sampling dates.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1731/842

The purpose of this study is to analyze simultaneously the effect of the heat of respiration and three types of boundary conditions; two of them constants (Case I, θ = 1 and Case II, θ = 0) and a time-dependent (Case III, simulating the change of temperature along the day-night cycle) on the flow patterns, the isotherms and heat transfer to the environment. The governing equations were solved via spatial discretization using second order finite differences and time discretization using an implicit scheme. The set of algebraic equations generated was solved using Nonlinear Relaxation. In this simulation, the thermodynamic properties of sorghum grain stored in a silo of 44 m3 grain capacity were used. Stability for Case I and II, were reached in a dimensionless time (Fo) equals 0.3 (that is equivalent a real time of 3.01 h), while for Case III was for Fo = 20 (equivalent to 200.88 h) because the periodicity of the boundary condition. For cases II and III, the boundary conditions induce the formation of multicellular flow.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1721/838

In this paper the results of artificial wetland (AW) with a puliment filter (PF) to obtain a good water quality for aquaculture activities are presented. An AW of 55 m2 was connected to an intermitent vertical flow, with four doses daily of 1,000 L of water, that is equivalent to 72 mm3/mm2 day of superficial hydraulic charge (SHC). The finality of this AW, was to remove organic material, nitrogen and phosphorous. A PF of 1.8 m2 was installed in order to eliminate PO4 3-. During 12 months of operation, the total remotion reached 92% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 85% of N-NH4 and 80% of PO4 3-. The final water quality obtained in this system can be considered good for aquaculture purposes.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1722/839

For determining the mass removal of COD from the system working at steady state, several organic, (L, kg DQO/m3s), and hydraulic loads, (Q, m3/m2 d), were applied according to a factorial experimental design and two types of wastewater. L values were tested in the range of 5 to 72 kg DQO/m3 d, more than ten times higher than values used in sanitary wastewater treatment, to demonstrate that the packing’s design is able to handle them. Mass removal was obtained from 3 to 10 kg DQO/m3 d with no limitation of oxygen transfer. Using the kinetic model proposed by Eckenfelder based on L and the specific area of the packing, the treatment of synthetic wastewater produced a value of the kinetic constant of 0.0423 kg DQO/m2 d and for the wastewater prepared from whey was 0.0867 kgDQO/m2 d.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1725/841

The results obtained shows that the ionic interaction of the NH+3 groups liked to the chitosan chain with the SPD anionic groups is depending of the pH of the swelling solvent. Were studied the swelling properties of the chitosan/SPD in function the the swelling media pH (3, 5, 7, and 11) and the percentage of solids in the hydrogel (2, 3, and 4% w/w). In the acid swelling medium the swelling capacity of the hydrogels was higher respect to the capacities obtained in basic and neutral media; moreover with a percentage of solids of 2% w/w the swelling capacities were higher. An overshooting effect in the hydrogels was observed, followed by a lost in the volume of the hydrogels until the swelling equilibrium is attained.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1732/843

The process model is based on the moments technique. The methodological process consisted on the implementation of a SISO (single input-single output) feedback servocontrol algorithm and a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller. The tuning was carried out with the strategies of internal model control (IMC). The process variable to control was the average diameter in % volume D(4,3) =µ4/µ3, because is a useful variable in both commercial and industrial environment; the manipulate variable in isothermic operation and for cooling was the solute concentration in the feeder and cooling temperature, respectively. Since static analysis were obtained zones where the presence of limits cycle exists and values of more favorable residence times to operate and control the crystallization process for isothermic and cooling operation. Feedback PID controller in the two operations was satisfactory eliminating the deviations between the adjustmentpoint and the response of the controllable variable.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1733/844

The structure of the complex systems offers some control challenges arising from the transfer of vapor (or liquid) streams between the columns. In particular, the presence of recycle streams in the coupled schemes has influenced the notion that control problems might be expected during the operation of those systems with respect to the rather well-known behavior of conventional distillation sequences. That has been one of the main reasons for the lack of industrial implementation of thermally coupled distillation schemes. Recently, some alternate schemes to Petlyuk column have been proposed. In this work, we analyze the control properties of two alternative distillation schemes to the Petlyuk column. The dynamic behavior is analyzed using the technique of singular value decomposition and rigorous dynamic simulations. The results indicate that alternate structures show better control properties than traditional Petlyuk structure",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1734/845

In both cases, conditions change abruptly. In this study, the interface between physics and chemical engineering is examined from the point of view of the laws of mechanics, and the details of this particular interface are clarified from the perspective of Euler (1703-1783) and Cauchy (1789-1857). Understanding how different perspectives of the laws of mechanics are connected allows us to proceed with confidence from physics to the traditional studies of fluid mechanics that one encounters in chemical engineering. Furthermore, it allows us to proceed with confidence to the study of multi-component transport phenomena. Here we encounter the concept of the species velocity that plays a crucial role in chemical engineering. To understand the importance of the species velocity, one asks the question: What happens if all species velocities are equal? The answer to this question is: Nothing! There is no purification, no mixing, no interfacial mass transfer, no adsorption/desorption, no homogeneous reaction, and no heterogeneous reaction. To illustrate how the concepts of mechanics provide a connection between various elements of chemical engineering, we examine the species mass jump condition as a focal point for mass transfer, heat transfer, thermodynamics, adsorption/desorption, and heterogeneous chemical reaction",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1709/828
