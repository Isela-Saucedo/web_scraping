Inside refineries the FCC process is the primary SOx generator. In order to avoid SOx emission the DeSOx additives are used. In this work DeSOx additives based on Mg-Al hydrotalcites on clay and modified with Ce and V has been prepared. The additives were characterized in their textural properties, crystallographic phases by XRD. Finally, the additives were evaluated on the SOx adsorption; they presented a high adsorption capacity at the FCC operating conditions and also good regeneration ability.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2188/1145

The surface acidity was determinated by adsorption of piridine and Hammett indicators, indicated a population of Brönsted type sites above 876 umol/g. The textural parameters of the supports and catalysts, such as surface area, pore volume and mean pore size were determined by means of N 2 physical adsorption. The results showed an increased in surface area (23 m 2 /g to 105 m 2 /g). The catalitic activity of the clay modified was evaluated by the alkylat on of i-C 4 parafins, at the bench scale in a fixed bed reactor, both in liquid and gas phase, using a iC 4 /C 4= molar ratio, which led to 5.5 % trimethylpentanes against 35.9 % of C 8= and 53.4 % of heavier C 9+ products for the catalysts prepared in liquid phase having higher acid strength, i.e. Ho ≈ -9.3. The catalysts were activated with trifluorometansulfonic acid.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2191/1147

The titania covered supports were prepared by impregnating the alumina support with titanium isopropoxide and then fluidizing the solid sample with an air stream saturated with water. The catalysts in their oxidic form were characterized by BET surface area, porosity, UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance (DRS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed sulfiding (TPS), and in their sulfided form by TPR-S. Sulfidation and reducibility of the catalysts were better for the catalyst supported on alumina covered with 3 wt. % titania, in agreement with the DRS results which show an increase in the ratio of  octahedral to tetrahedral Ni. The incorporation of titania to the alumina support leads to a decrease of inactiveNiAl 2 O 4 spinel.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2192/1149

The catalytic fiber exhibited high activity for this process at low temperatures. The CuO/SiO 2 catalyst with the same CuO content was less active than the CuO/fiberglass system under the same conditions examined. However these catalysts gave a different product distribution at all temperatures. The effects of time-on-stream as well as reaction temperature upon the catalytic activity and selectivity of cyclohexane oxidation were investigated. Among the selected temperatures, the best one corresponds to 300°C. At this temperature, the steady-state catalytic performance of the CuO/fiberglass system was recorded with only a slightly deactivation after 4 h time-on stream in the present study.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2193/1150

The effect of sulfation on the physical chemical properties, using three techniques and two sulfate ions sources was studied. The materials were characterized by DRX, SEM and physisorption of N 2 , potentometric titration with n-butylamine, dehydration of 2-propanol, and their catalytic activity was tested in n-hexane isomerization reaction. The results of characterization showed that the sulfation effect increased the formation of porous materials when sulphuric acid is used as sulfate source and the solid is impregnated with method 3 (impregnation technique), decreasing specific area and increasing crystalline state and the number of acid sites per unit area. The main product of 2-propanol dehydration was propylene and diisopropylic ether. Isomerization n-hexane activity was greater on samples treated with sulphuric acid.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2194/1151

The long -range approximation of Ponce and Renon for the spherical square-well fluid is used in conjunction with Parsons decoupling approximation. The theory is extended to include the nematic phase. For the phase diagram, a vapour-liquid-nematic triple point is predicted below which the nematic phase coexists with the vapour phase. The “Convex Peg” model is used to predict the Isotropic-Nematic transition for p-azoxyanisole (PAA). Thermodynamic properties are predicted with good accuracy. Limitations of the present model in the prediction of thermodynamics properties of real liquid crystal systems are discussed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2225/1171

Miscibility, ascertained by the existence of a single glass transition in the mixtures, is achieved only between the PEOx and a copolymer with high acrylic acid content (20 wt.%). For blends where the PEAA have acrylic acid content is minor to 10 wt.% overall immiscibility was detected. FTIR spectroscopy demonstrates that miscibility is enhanced by hydrogen bonding interactions between the amide groups of the PEOx and the carboxylic groups of the acrylic acid units in the copolymer. Tensile stress-strain tests reveal that the 20 and the 40 wt% PEOx blends exhibit synergism in mechanical properties, i.e., better ultimate properties. SEM micrographs of the fracture surface show brittle fracture in blends with high content in PEOx, and ductile fracture in the blends with low PEOx content.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2226/1172

However, this technology can result in the reduction of meat quality due, among others, to proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria. The effect of lactic fermentation using strains of Staphylococcus carnosus and Lactobacillus alimentarius upon myofibrillar proteins of pork was studied in vacuum packaged samples stored during 96 h at 4°C and 19oC. Electrophoretic patterns of the major myofibrillar proteins (myosin and actin) in SDS polyacrylamide gels were compared. At both temperatures three bands were observed at 96 h of study, in the control and inoculated samples with lactic acid bacteria, three bands identified as heavy myosin degradation products, whereas no degradation was observed for actin.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2227/1173
