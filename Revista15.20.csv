Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Editorial,"With this issue I end my period as co-editor in chief of the Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas. Thierry Calmus will remain in charge for a while to help with the transition. The new editors are Ángel Nieto Samaniego and Peter Schaaf. Both have extensive experience as scientific editors and I am confident they will continue to improve the quality of the articles published in our journal as well as providing new ideas and renewed energy to the editorial work.In the three years I have had the honor of serving as co-editor-in-chief, along with Dr. Calmus have tried to improve the quality of the journal through a better selection of manuscripts and favoring the publication of papers of interest to a broader audience or that have impact on other disciplines. Today our rejection rate is about 50% and we have slightly reduced the number of articles published in each issue. The Revista remains Mexico's first publication in the field of Geosciences based on impact factor (according to the Journal of Citation Report) and H factor (according to SCImago Journal Ranking). In the near future we also hope to start using the online editorial system (Open Journal System) for the reviewing process, which has already been implemented for storing past issues on the UNAM journals website (http://www.revistas.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg).",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/588/458
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"The San Mateo fault: New paleoseismological evidences of active faulting in the Acambay graben, Mexico","This study focuses on the identification and seismic characterization of the San Mateo fault, herein described for the first time. This fault is located in the central part of the Acambay graben, central Mexico. It is a 13 km long active normal fault with E-W direction and dip to the south. Two trenches were excavated in the locality of La Lechuguilla to determine the recent chronology of paleoearthquakes along this fault and to estimate its seismic parameters. At least three paleo-breaks have been found in one of these trenches and new radiocarbon ages indicate that they occurred from Late Pleistocene to the Holocene times. The oldest event (Event 1) occurred in 31.0-29.3 ky cal BP. Event 2 occurred in 19.1–6.5 ky cal BP and the younger faulting (Event 3) in 6.0 to 4.2 cal ky BP. These results suggest a recurrence interval of surface rup- tures of about 11.57 ± 5.32 ky. A slip rate of 0.085 ± 0.025 mm / year and a magnitude (Mw) of 6.43 to 6.76 is estimated from the maximum coseismic displacement of 0.85 ± 0.163 m and a rupture length of 13 km. If we consider a maximum rupture length of 25 km, including the possible continuity of the fault under the present day sediments filling the graben, a Mw magnitude of 6.7 ± 0.3 could be expected. The paleo- seismic data and fault scaling relationships suggest that the San Mateo fault is a significant seismic source in terms of hazard. This study also highlights the recency of the volcanic activity in the Acambay graben.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/589/459

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,The Difunta Correa metasedimentary sequence (NW Argentina): relict of a Neoproterozoic platform? — elemental and Sr-Nd isotope evidence,"The Sierra de Pie de Palo (Western Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina) in the Andean foreland is mainly formed by a Mesoproterozoic basement and an Ediacaran metasedimentary cover referred to as the Difunta Correa metasedimentary sequence. The latter is key to understanding the characteristics of this region prior to the early Cambrian assembly of SW Gondwana. It is composed of low- to medium grade metamorphic rocks (metasandstones, mica-schists, Ca-pelitic schists, metaconglomerates, marbles and less abundant amphibolites) that can be grouped into four informal lithostratigraphic units. The chemical composition of these rocks allows to classify the siliciclastic protoliths as shales, Fe-shales and immature sandstones (wackes, sub-litharenites, litharenites and Fe-sandstones). The sediments were derived from an evolved felsic to intermediate continental source and were deposited on a continental passive margin overlaying a Mesoproterozoic basement that crops out at several places of the Western Sierras Pampeanas. Thick marine carbonate beds with seawater isotope composition, phosphatic clasts and the lack of contemporaneous, arc related igneous rocks, also support a passive margin sedimentation. Phosphatic clasts within metaconglomerates are described for the first time in the Sierras Pampeanas and were probably formed after an important Neoproterozoic glaciation (Marinoan). We further suggest, based on our data and previous works, that the passive margin probably belonged to the Paleoproterozoic MARA (acronym of Maz, Arequipa, Río Apa) continental block. MARA, which remained juxtaposed to Laurentia since the middle to late Mesoproterozoic orogenies until its eventual drifting in the late Neoproterozoic, finally accreted to SW Gondwana in early Cambrian times during the Pampean orogeny.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/591/462
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"The Choiyoi Group (lower-middle Permian) in the Cordillera Frontal of Calingasta. San Juan, Argentina: arc volcanism associated to extension","The southern portion of the Cordillera Frontal of San Juan (western Argentina) comprises some of the best exposures of the Choiyoi Group, the eruptive counterpart of a large silicic plutono-volcanic province   of Permian-Triassic age developed on the southwestern margin of Gondwana. Stratigraphic, petrologic, and geochronologic studies allowed to recognize aspects of the physical volcanology, eruptive history, and petrogenetic evolution of this unit. The most common rocks are welded rhyolitic ignimbrites and lava flows. Phreatomagmatic deposits, subvolcanic intrusions and volcaniclastic sediments are less common. The eruptive volumes increased gradually from the emplacement of andesitic flows, rhyolite domes and ignimbrites intercalated between relatively thin sequences of volcaniclastic sediments, to almost uninterrupted successions of voluminous rhyolitic flows and thick ignimbrites related to volcano-tectonic collapse events. The volcanic activity began at ca. 290 Ma following the San Rafael orogenic phase as suggested by previously reported paleontological and radiometric data. A new U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age from the upper levels of the sequence with a value of 265 ± 2 Ma suggests that the duration of volcanism was about 25 m.y. Geochemically the succession shows a restricted compositional spectrum. All units have intermediate to silicic composition (>65% SiO2) with a clear acidification trend toward increasingly younger terms. It corresponds to rhyolites, dacites and traquidacites, mostly of high-K calc-alkaline and peraluminous affinities. Major and trace element contents suggest that magmas were emplaced in a non-thickened crust and evolved  mainly through fractional crystallization processes. Trace element patterns show enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (Cs, Ba, Rb, K) in relation to high field strength elements (HFSE) and depressions in Nb, Ta and Ti, typical features of orogenic series. Progressive enrichment in HFSE (Nb, Ta, Y) with age suggests an increase in the within-plate affinity. This compositional change would relate to increasingly voluminous and differentiated magmatic pulses generated as a consequence of the arc system maturation and to a subduction related, progressively extensional tectonic regime. A plausible explanation to the observed variations is the retreating of the subducted slab (slab rollback) in the final stages of Gondwana orogeny.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/592/463
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Magma mixing on the Famatinian magmatic arc from northwest Argentina: Example in the Diablillos intrusive complex, southern Puna","On the eastern edge of the southern Puna, Inca Viejo range, NW Argentina, outcrops of the Diablillos intrusive complex are composed of a series of calc-alkaline magmatic arc rocks represented by monzogranite, granodiorite, tonalite and diorite. The monzogranite and intermediate rocks contain abundant enclaves and dismembered dikes. Field relationships, petrographic and geochemical studies suggest that the main mechanism of magmatic differentiation of the magmas was by magma mixing and mingling. Rocks of intermediate composition, such as granodiorite and tonalite correspond to a mixing forming process between crustal and mantle-derived magmas. Magma mixing is observable in the field (microgranular mafic enclaves) and evidenced in the geochemical diagrams (magmatic evolution by no-cotectic line), however, a complex magmatic evolution by processes of fractional crystallization and assimilation of country rocks, can not be ruled out. Contact relationships between the different lithological types and enclave-host, suggest that a magma chamber was formed by multiple pulses and was emplaced in middle levels of the continental crust. In a local and regional context, the geochemical affinities and the age of the Diablillos intrusive complex (501±17 Ma, U/Pb on circon) are consistent with the magmatism of the Oire eruptive complex. Magma mixing is one of the main mechanisms intervening in the origin and evolution of lower Paleozoic magmatism in the Famatinian arc, associated to a subduction setting.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/593/465

Historical evolution from relative dating","La Pedriza del Manzanares is a granite landscape protected within the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (Madrid, Spain). These granites create a landscape alternating fresh outcrops, regolith zones and numerous individual boulders that have been transported and partially buried by slope deposits. Erosion of the materials covering these boulders has allowed the identification of several levels of flared slopes and tafoni formed from successive episodes of soil stabilisation. By relating peak height from flared slopes and/or tafoni to the erosion rates for similar climatic areas, we estimated the required time for the formation of these morphologies. The method used provides an adequate tool for the relative dating of slopes in areas of similar geomorphology.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/597/468
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Evaluation of environmental pollution from the magnetic increase in urban dusts. A case study for the city of Mexicali, Mexico","Assessments of magnetic enhancement on urban dust samples collected on different surfaces, mostly paved and unpaved roads, were performed in order to evaluate the environmental contamination in Mexicali (medium-sized city on the Mexico-USA border). Rock and mineral magnetic techniques consisted of systematic measurements   of mass-specific magnetic susceptibility and isothermal remanent magnetization at 0.7 T. Magnetic enhancement was estimated by comparing magnetic concentration for each sample relative to reference value obtained from the site with almost no human activity also known as conservation area in the suburb of town. Additional magnetic parameters as the S-200 ratio and Curie temperatures were used to identify predominant magnetic carriers. These experiments indicate that impure magnetic is the main mineral in most studied samples. Geostatistical analysis and interpolation techniques (experimental variogram and ordinary Kriging, respectively) were carried out in order to determine the spatial distribution of magnetic enhancement and relative levels  of environmental contamination. High traffic roads with industrial areas as well as some land categories yielded unusually high level of contamination.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/598/469
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Impact of leachate generated in the municipal landfill of Linares (Nuevo León ) on the quality of surface water and groundwater,"This research deals with the quality of natural waters affected by pollution from leachate generated in the Municipal Landfill of Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The Municipal Landfill of Linares has more than 17 years of service and receives more than 50 ton/day of municipal solid waste. Geological (geological structural profiles), hydrogeological (piezometric cards) and hydrogeochemical (water quality classification and determination of pollutants) methods were applied to identify external agents to the environment. A negative impact on the quality of surface water (dam El Cinco) and groundwater (wells) in accordance with national and international environmental standards (NOM, WHO, US EPA) were identified. The results reveal deficiencies in the management and final disposal of municipal solid waste (torn geomembrane) and null leachate management (oversaturation of the landfill). In particular, high concentrations of NO3, Pb, Mn and Fe in groundwater and surface runoff were identifying, which generate a significant contamination of soil and water; aspect very important if people in the region consume contaminated water from groundwater wells, that can cause harmful health effects.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/599/470
