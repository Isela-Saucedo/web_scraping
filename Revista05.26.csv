The main model contribution, consisted on taking into account a hysteresis phenomena inside of the particles soil, where the initial desorption and solubilization equilibrium path of TPHs (linear isotherm) was considered to be different at the second readsorption equilibrium path (Langmuir isotherm) during intraparticle diffusivity of hydrocarbons. The Langmuir isotherm consideration, allowed explaining the retarded diffusion due to readsorption equilibrium. Model dimensionless also generate four non-dimensional numbers: bioavailability I (BnI) and II (BnII), Biot of mass (Bim) and readsorption module (η) that allowed establishing the control mechanism of the biodegradation process. The model validation was carried out by their use to describe and to predict the biodegradation of weathering TPHs in a soil with 150,000 mg/kg of contamination level. The model was also capable to describe the biodegradation of weathering TPHs from the same soil, previously treated with toluene. The model could be used as platform to develop scale-up approaches, and to improve the sludge bioreactors performance",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1752/859

In the present study, Bifidobacterium infantis cells were inoculated in culture media with initial pH of 7.0, 4.0, 3.0 and 2.0 respectively for 24 h. As the initial pH decreases, the active cell population decreased to three orders of magnitude. At pH 4.0 the cells were maintained stable during the first 5 h of fermentation. In addition, cells adapted to low pH were smaller than the original strain. The acid pH-adapted strains showed low expression levels of two membrane proteins of approximately 18 to 20 kDa.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1754/860

A number of modifications to increase the production and yield of ethanol have been implemented such as immobilization of cells, genetic modification and use of mixed cultures. In this work, the addition of zeolites to increase the alcohol production of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. The experiments were designed with seven factors for ethanol yield (carbon and nitrogen source, Mg2+ and zeolite concentration, temperature, pH and inoculum size) at two levels with an orthogonal array layout of L8 (27) designed to keep the number of experiments to a minimum. Addition of 0.2 g L-1 of Valfor® 100 zeolite NaA resulted in important increases in ethanol production (20%) and yield (25%). An adsorption phenomenon could be observed by SEM between the zeolite particles and the yeast cells. This and the well known effects of toxic cation concentration decrease, pH regulation and ethanol and carbon dioxide adsorption could have caused the improvement in the ethanol production and yield. The optimization study indicated that zeolite concentration was the most significant factor in this increase even though it was used at lower levels compared with other studies, indicating the importance of the optimization studies in bioprocesses.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1755/861

Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy indicated that banana starch showed a band at 1740 cm-1 that corresponds to stretching of C-O in the acetyl groups. Morphological studies demonstrated that a higher damage in the starch granules occurred as the degree substitution was higher. This effect was more notorious in the pasting profile because the ABSHDS did not exhibit the viscosity peak, breakdown and setback parameters. The average gelatinization temperature was similar in the native sample and in the ABSLDS, but was lower in the ABSHDS. The enthalpy of gelatinization was low in the ABSHDS, indicating a higher disorganization of the double helices in the amylopectin due to higher degree of acetylation. As the degree of acetylation increased the retrogradation decreased. Banana starch with different acetylation degrees possess varied physicochemical properties that provide them with potentially wide applications spectra.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1775/877

The wastewaters for indigo blue used are thought to be contaminated because; indigo can be oxidized to isatin, which is hydrolyzed to antranilic acid, a compound that is toxic to aquatic life. Indigo oxidation was evaluated using a model solution that simulated a textile wastewater. Three oxidation systems: electro incineration, chemical coagulation using Al2 (SO4)3, and enzymatic degradation with laccase. With electro incineration, the indigo solution was completely discolored; chemical oxidation demand diminution was 98 % in approximately 3 hours and indigo blue was mineralized with no sludge production. Chemical coagulation with 40 mg L-1 sulfate aluminum removed some color though control of pH was necessary. At pH 5, the chemical oxygen demand was reduced by 76 %, with sludge formation. Laccase enzyme, processing required 72 hours for complete discoloration of the indigo model solution; chemical oxidation demand diminution was nearby 50 %, but laccase could not mineralize the dye. Toxicity assays indicated that the processes generated more toxic products than the control",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1757/863

Biological sludge from a municipal and industrial (brewery and pulp and paper) wastewater treatment plant using a UASB reactor was used. During the operation of the mesophilic batch system, the volatile solids (VS) were reduced from 60.3% (15.67 g/L) up to 37.5% (9.67 g/L) with 31 d of treatment time. The mesophilic process presented a stable operation reducing 38% of VS with 1.76 Kg VS m-3d-1of organic load feed fulfilling with the criterion of vectors attraction reduction. However, in mesophilic conditions, the digested sludge must be post-treated with a process of pathogenic microorganism inactivation because only remove low concentrations of pathogenic microorganism. The obtained results demonstrated that the process in thermophilic conditions (55°C) is capable to stabilize 3.9 Kg VS m-3d-1and to inactive the totality of fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp. and helminth ova fulfilling with the permissible limits for class A biosolids.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1763/870

The literature is concerned about the large chemical and petrochemical plants mainly; consequently the most relevant parameters are those which affect these kinds of industries, for example commodities and pseudo-commodities. This work focus in the different characteristics according to the process and product involved (fine chemicals, f.i.). With these facts in mind the usual decomposition procedure is applied (macro and micro levels), with the relevant parameter obtained by the new proposal. After that, in the micro level, AHP technique allows to make a decision with a sound basis, comparing the parameters chosen to evaluate the definitive location",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1756/862

The intercalation-pillaring process is carried out through the initial insertion of polycations around 9.6 Å in size and the possible formation of γ-AlOOH after calcined. Characterization of the pillaring agent obtained by direct way from precursor solution (basic aluminum nitrate) allowed the identification of crystalline species whose diffraction patterns show the possible occurrence of the ε-keggin ion (ε-keggin nitrate).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1778/879

Therefore, the viscoelastic behavior of solutions and hydrated tablets of the individual polymers and their mixtures was studied at different pHs. The viscoelastic behavior of solutions and tablets was different, but it was pH dependent. At pH 1.3 the largest differences were observed.

Composites using virgin, reprocessed or recycled polypropylene were prepared at different fiber concentrations. Henequen fiber instead of agave fiber was used to prepare other composites as reference. Stress-strain behavior, flexure and falling dart impact testing, were followed to evaluate composites performance.

The,"The Stefan-Maxwell equations represent a special form of the species momentum equations that are used to determine species velocities. These species velocities appear in the species continuity equations that are used to predict species concentrations. These concentrations are required, in conjunction with concepts from thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, to calculate rates of adsorption/desorption, rates of interfacial mass transfer, and rates of chemical reaction. These processes are central issues in the discipline of chemical engineering. In this paper we first outline a derivation of the species momentum equations and indicate how they simplify to the Stefan- Maxwell equations.We then examine three important forms of the species continuity equation in terms of three different diffusive fluxes that are obtained from the Stefan-Maxwell equations. Next we examine the structure of the species continuity equations for binary systems and then we examine some special forms associated with N-component systems. Finally the general N-component system is analyzed using the mixed-mode diffusive flux and matrix methods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1748/855
