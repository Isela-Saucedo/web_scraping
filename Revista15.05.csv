Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Stratigraphic architecture, depositional environments and geochronology of the Olinalá Formation (late Permian), northeastern Guerrero, Mexico","The Olinalá Formation is a marine-continental Permian sedimentary succession of ~ 860 m thick exceptionally exposed in the northeast of Guerrero, in southern Mexico. The stratigraphic architecture of this sedimentary succession corresponds to a homoclinal carbonate ramp system with siliciclastic influence. This succession contains a wide diversity of siliciclastic continental and marine facies, and carbonate marine facies that indicate its development in warm waters under marine conditions. Siliciclastic facies include: conglomeratic sandstone, cross-stratification polymictic conglomerate, trough cross-stratification sandstone, quartz-crinoid conglomerate, and graded quartz-sandstone. Shallow marine and outer shelf facies include: bioturbed sandstone and black shales. Carbonate facies represent predominantly shelf margin environments and include: crinoid-bryozoan-brachiopod grainstone, coralline red algae biohermal, muddy brachiopod packstone, fusulinid wackestone, and radiolarian wackestone.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1576/1395
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Cretaceous cultch: substrate availability for oyster Exogyra in the Maastrichtian of the eastern Mississippi Embayment,"The gryphaeid oysterExogyraSay, 1820, is ubiquitous in Upper Cretaceous sediments in the southeastern United States. Like many oysters (Order Ostreida),Exogyraattached its shell to hard surfaces on the seafloor by means of cementation. Throughout its lifetime,Exogyramay preserve through bioimmuration the characteristics and even skeletal remains of substrate organisms, including mollusk shells, echinoids, and bryozoans.Exogyra costataof all sizes were collected from three different localities within upper Maastrichtian deposits in northeast Mississippi and their bioimmurations analyzed. Substrates were identified and classified to compare the three localities’ substrate taxa in order to probe differences in benthic population structure. The results of this pilot study provide an overview of available surfaces on the Late Cretaceous seafloor on the eastern side of the Mississippi Embayment. The data suggest that taxonomic diversity among utilized substrates may increase from north to south, which corresponds to increasing depth from shallow marine to deeper sediments on the shelf.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1580/1397
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Lithofacies and mineralogy of sinter deposits from San Agustín del Maíz geothermal zone, Michoacán, Mexico","In the active San Agustín del Maíz geothermal zone (Michoacán), we identified silica-sinter deposits co-existing with hot springs. Considering the deposition mode, these deposits are separated into fracture-banded and bedded deposits. The first ones are associated with deposition on the channels from the fluids rising to the surface, while the second ones are formed from the geothermal fluids that reached the surface. The bedded deposits showed different types of lithofacies grouped in a range with two endmembers: on the one hand, a pure silica-sinter deposit characterized by high density, glassy aspect and being consolidated. On the other hand, a silty-sandy deposit, that easily disaggregate, presenting impression of plants and lithics. The vitreous deposit is considered geyserite, formed from fluids with temperatures superior to 70 °C, while the silty-sandy deposits are formed from fluids with temperatures below 70 °C and, in some cases, far away from the water source. The geyserite deposits are mineralogically composed only by opal (C and CT), while the silty-sandy deposits are formed by opal in association with other mineralogical phases (linked to sediments). Consequently, we recognized that the lithofacies and the mineralogy of the silica-sinter deposits give information of the temperatures and deposition rates of the parental fluids. This information could be very useful in order to identify setting where existed grater geothermal up flow and temperature (e.g.geiserite facies) in areas with similar geological context to San Agustín del Maíz (e.g.central sector of the Cinturón Volcánico Trans-Mexicano). These sceneries can be associated to structural settings like fault intersections, fault-tips and relay-ramps.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1585/1398
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Magnetic parameters as indicators of major elements and lead contamination in urban soils from Aburrá valley, Colombia","We report an environmental magnetism study aimed to determine the relationship between heavy metals and magnetic parameters in urban soils of the Metropolitan Area of Aburrá Valey, Colombia, in order to establish magnetic indicators which in turn may allow the identification of high pollution areas. The study was carried out on 83 urban soil samples, which were subjected to a magnetic analysis, the concentration of the major elements (Al2O3, Fe2O3and MnO) and Pb concentration determined by means of X-ray fluorescence. A significant variation is observed in the distribution of the magnetic material in the urban soil, which contains a mixture of relatively low coercivity magnetite minerals of both natural and anthropogenic origin. Superparamagnetic size particles were detected in medium and low concentrations in soils with low anthropic activity, suggesting a natural origin. On the other hand, by combining the magnetic parameters and thermomagnetic curves, soils with a high concentration of anthropic magnetic mineral were revealed. Al2O3and Fe2O3concentrations are high in most urban soils compared to MnO content. The areas characterized with low anthropic activity showed low content of Pb.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1586/1405
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Feasibility of urban waste for constructing Technosols for plant growth,"An alternative for sustainable urban development is to revegetate cities with the construction of planters as well as to recover degraded sites. The objective of this work was to characterize urban waste materials produced in Mexico City and to evaluate their potential for constructing Technosols for plant growth, as an alternative to use in revegetating the city without affecting natural landscapes. Construction and demolition waste materials amended with different application rates of compost made out of gardening wastes from Mexico City green areas were tested. Nine mixtures were prepared; three based on concrete, three based on demolition waste and three based on excavation waste. Changes on physical, chemical and physicochemical properties of these mixtures, namely nutrient contents, water retention and aeration capacity, were monitored in a twelve-month experiment. The mineralogy and the risk regarding the release of heavy metals and trace elements were also evaluated in the soluble fraction. The constructed Technosols were appropriate, to a greater or lesser extent, for tomato plant growth. Soil pH and soil electrical conductivity (EC) were the main factors defining their suitability; both parameters changed over time due to the washing of salts. The particle size of the mineral materials as well as the application rates of compost used in the construction of the Technosols resulted in adequate water holding capacity and soil aeration for plant growth. The type of parental materials defined the majority of the Technosol characteristics as well as their ability to function as a plant support. The concentrations of readily available heavy and trace metals were not a limitation for plant growth. However, potential co-transport of these elements with soluble organic matter should be considered in further research.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1583/1402
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Emplacement of Paleocene-Eocene magmatism under transtensional regime and its evolution to a dynamic equilibrium on the western edge of Colombia,"The Cretaceous and Paleogene magmatic arcs of the Central and Western Cordilleras of Colombia have been attributed to the evolution of a subduction system in the Colombian Pacific coast. In this work the distribution and crystallization ages of plutons emplaced between 60 Ma and 53 Ma in the Central and Western Cordilleras are analyzed.From 53 Ma the magmatic arc migrates towards the west of Colombia, installing magmas in a plate edge transitional crust. The crystallization ages analyzed in this work suggest that, within the study area, the plutonic belt is continuous throughout the Western Cordillera. From 40±5 Ma to 26 Ma there was a significant reduction in the convergence velocity of the Farallon plate; as it decreases, also the tectonic loading diminishes resulting in a process of regional stress relaxation. The process of relaxation of the regional stress also occurred in the intra-continental environments producing peneplanization process in the topographic highs of northern Colombia, the reactivation of the piedmont with westwards progradation of sedimentation and the development of a middle- to late-Eocene regional unconformity. In continental shelf environments, the relaxation of the tectonic stress is evidenced by the distribution of reef limestone sequences throughout the Colombian Pacific margin and the Caribbean of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, and by a magmatic gap from 33 Ma to 26 Ma. The Paleocene-Eocene magmatic event distributed in the Central and Western Cordilleras took place under a transtensional regime, with the maximum horizontal compressive stress (σ1) oriented SW-NE, product of the oblique convergence between the Farallon and South American plates.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1570/1399
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"The fossil record of turtles and tortoises (Testudines) of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Islands, with comments on its taxonomy and paleobiogeography: a bibliographic review","Testudines is the crown-group that includes all living forms of turtles and their closest relatives. This group is known from the late Triassic and persists to this day. The fossil record of Testudines in Mexico is scarce and has been previously compiled in several papers. Here we present an update including all osteological and ichnological records from México and Central America. In Mexico, the Testudines fossil record extends from the Late Triassic to the Pleistocene, being widely abundant during the Pleistocene.KinosternonandGopherusare the best represented taxa, known from the late Miocene (Hemphillian) to the late Pleistocene (Rancholabrean). Fossil turtles are well represented in Mexico, excluding the states of Campeche, Mexico City, Colima, Guerrero, Queretaro, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa. On the contrary, the ichnological records are only known in Coahuila, Puebla and Zacatecas. In Central America there are records of fossil turtles in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama, the latter being the country holding most records. Finally, nine new species have been described in the region, six for Mexico (Notoemystlaxiacoensis,Yelmochelysrosarioae,Mexichelyscoahuilaensis,Gopherusdonlaloi,G.auffenbergiandG.pargensis, of whichG.auffenbergiis synonymous withG.berlandieriandG.pargensisis considered anomenvanum) and three in Central America (Rhinoclemmysnicoyamafrom Costa Rica, andRhinoclemmyspanamaensisandStaurotypusmoschusfrom Panama).",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1581/1400
