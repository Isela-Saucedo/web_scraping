The activity of the catalyst depends on the feed composition and has a maximum when CH4:CO2is 1:1. This fact is due to a synergic effect between the carbon produced from methane decomposition and the oxygen generated from CO2 dissociation, resulting a redox equilibria at the metal-support interface. At these conditions CO2 acts as controlling reagent, but for CH4:CO2=1:2 this fact is cancelled, and no coke is produced, though the activity is lower than when ratio is 1:1. Coke deposits are graphitic, and they are mainly due to methane cracking. In spite of part of Zn2+reduction and lost of subsequent Zn by evaporating occurs at high temperatures, spinel structure is maintained and no effect in catalytic activity and selectivity is observed during the studied time on stream. Catalyst stability is maintained also under higher coke formation conditions. A model has been developed representing both the initial loss of weight due to reduction and the coke produced during reaction.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2200/1154

The NO adsorption studies on the sulfided unpromoted Mo catalysts showed that the variation of total NO adsorbed and the catalytic activity follow a similar trend with the Ti content. However, in the case of the promoted catalysts the results indicate the presence of less sulfided Co and Ni species at intermediate Ti contents. Activity variations with Ti content were associated to changes in sulfidation evidenced by the NO frequency band shifts. Moreover, the changes induced by the presence of titania, on the molybdenum sulfided phases after the reaction test, can be assessed in part by the TPR-S technique. A quantitative analysis of the UV signal in the region 25-300 °C of the TPR-S patterns show that the H2S produced in this region, which is related to the number of sulfur vacancies created, coincide with the HDS activity trend",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2202/1155

The membrane was applied on a conductive resin support. In this work some parameters of evaluation of this electrodes are presented. The electrodes exhibit linear response in the range 10-5 to 10-1 mol/dm3, with slopes of –61.82,-59.41 and –56.29 mV.decade-1 respectively with a shelf life of three months. The selectivity coefficients for various ions were calculated. The time response of the electrodes was determined (less than10 s). The influence of the pH on the response of the electrodes was also evaluated",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2203/1158

The samples were characterized by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction and gravimetric and differential thermal analysis. The materials were tested in the decomposition of 2-propanol in order to determine the acidity and basicity by alcohol dehydration and dehydrogenation, respectively. The sol-gel materials offer higher surface area and acidity, and better thermal behavior than the similar precipitation materials. The mixed oxides Zr-Ti with equimolar relation offer improved support catalytic propierties: a) higher surface area (250 m2/g sol-gel and 200 m2/g by precipitation, both samples calcined at 500ºC), b) a higher temperature of cristallization for the formation of ZrTiO4 (690ºC sol-gel and 640ºC precipitation) and c) higher rate for the decomposition of 2-propanol to propylene indicating the highest acidity. The presence of acid and basic sites in equimolar Zr-Ti support via sol-gel offers attractive bifunctional properties",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2211/1163

Microcapsules at pH 4 showed lower surface oil content, achieving the highest oil retention with 100% gum arabic. The thermo-oxidative stability of the oil contained in the microcapsules with different wall materials was evaluated by dynamic differential scanning calorimetry. The values of the activation energy varied from 70.27 to 295.99 kJ mol-1. In general terms the microcapsules made at pH 4 had better thermo-oxidative stability, with the exception of the microcapsules made with 100 % mesquite gum and 100% maltodextrin at pH 8, which exhibited activation energies of 295.99 and 228.80 kJ mol-1, respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2212/1164

This process also makes easier the extraction of chitin, pigments, proteins and lipids. The aim of this work was to establish the effect of carbohydrate source and inoculum level. Various cheap carbohydrate sources, such as sugar cane, lactose and whey powder at 10 and 20% (wet basis) were added to prawn head wastes; 5 and 10% (wet basis) of Lactobacillus plantarum were inoculated and incubated at 30°C during 4 days. Sugar cane showed the fastest pH drop (up to 4.4). Total titratable acidity of 3 % was determined after 48 hours. Lactic acid fermentation was performed in a solid state column reactor build with two parts, the upper part where the prawn waste was placed and the liquid fraction was collected in the lower part. The process was scaled-up to 2 kg in a solid state reactor. Fermentation time, deproteinisation and demineralisation were determined. At the sixth day of fermentation, deproteinisation and demineralisation were 89.4 % and 82.5 %, respectively.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2213/1165

Due to its particular color, it can be used to pigment salmonids, such as rainbow trout, in aquaculture systems. Astaxanthin is bound to a protein, this association results in a pink-orange hue. Prawn waste, besides being a problem to Mexican ecology due to its spoilage in open air, is an excellent source of astaxanthin. Use of lactic fermentation to deproteinize the waste and stabilize the pigment is explored. Starters of lactic acid bacteria were selected according to their ability to decrease pH in less than 24 h. Four solvent systems and three extraction periods were tested in order to obtain the best extraction conditions. Astaxanthin concentration in the extract were analyzed by HPLC using a reverse phase column. Detachment of the protein from the pigment was carried out using commercial proteases. Results showed that a strain of Lactobacillus sp., isolated from fish was the most efficient to decrease pH. The optimal solvent system to extract astaxanthin was petroleum ether:acetone:water (15:75:10). Comparing extraction from fermented to non fermented wastes, fermented wastes gave a higher amount of astaxanthin. Commercial proteases gave a very efficient hydrolysis of the protein-pigment complex",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2214/1166

Pork samples were vacuum packaged and stored at 4°C and 20°C for 96 hours. Enterobacteriaceae population, used as spoilage indicator, was significantly (P>0.003) reduced in fermented samples stored at 20°C. However, at this temperature significantly changes in color (P<0.0001) and texture (P<0.0035) were observed. At 4°C functional properties were not significantly modified (P>0.730 and P>0.738 respectively). Free fatty acids concentration increased in fermented meat, causing the accumulation of linoleic, oleic, palmitic and linolenic acids.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2216/1168

Chemical equilibrium is most fundamentally approached under thermodynamic considerations; however, equilibrium state can be obtained by considering the rates of the reactions, a kinetic approach. Here, we explain as an action-reaction analogy can be used for any elementary chemical equation. If the actual mechanism of the reaction is multistep, a similar analogy can be used in each step since usually at chemical equilibrium each elementary step in the mechanism is also at equilibrium",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2217/1169

Thc pm1ial differential equations ofthe mode\ are subjected to bounda¡y conditions, which may be choscn as any function ofthe time. The methodology followed here, exploits the simplicity of the separation of variables method and the superposition concept and, an eigenvalue or Sturm-Liouville problem is generated. The computation of the eigenvalues associated to the Sturm-Liouville problem is prcsented. The analytic solution is eva!uated using thrcc different time functionality of the bulk fluid conf:entration. The results show that the type of time functionality at the boundaries strongly affects the shape of the concentration pro file inside of the multi-layer system. In sorne case, the time functionality ofthe concentration does not lead to any steady statc. The main advantage ofthe analytic so!ution, when it is comparcd with that obtained numerically, is the lower CPU time uscd to evaluate thc solution of 1he problem with the same accuracy.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2218/1170
