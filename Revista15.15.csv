Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Petrography, geochemistry and stable isotopes of carbonate rocks, Lower Cretaceous Alisitos Formation, Los Torotes section, Baja California, Mexico","Petrography, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and major, trace, and rare earth elements geochemistry of limestones of the Alisitos Formation in the Los Torotes, Baja California were studied in order to document the elemental variations among Member C (MC) and Member E (ME) of the formation and to understand their diagenetic and depositional conditions. The major petrographic types identified are mudstone, wackestone and packstone. The limestones of the Alisitos Formation show significant variations in δ13C and δ18O values (+4.13 to +5.26‰; -14.17 to -6.84‰; respectively). The limestones from Member C (MC) show higher ΣREE content (23 ± 17, n=10) than Member E (ME) (11 ± 5.5, n=9) of the Alisitos Formation. The observed variations in ΣREE content in these limestones are due to the amount of detrital material present in them. The limestones from ME record seawater-like REE+Y patterns, whereas the MC records non-seawater-like signatures (i.e.significant enrichment of middle rare earth elements: MREE). Most of the analyzed samples from the Alisitos Formation show negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*: 0.67 – 0.99, n=17). The limestones show both negative and positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*: 0.58 ‒ 2.91, n=19). The positive Eu anomalies identified in many samples may be due to the influence of hydrothermal fluids or co-precipitation of hydrothermal Fe-sulfide. The limestones of ME exhibit seawater-like-REE patterns suggesting that most of the REEs present in them were derived from seawater. However, the limestones of MC were contaminated by detrital materials which effectively mask the seawater-like signatures. The detrital materials present in the limestones of MC were probably derived from the mafic to felsic source rocks.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/458/414

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Análisis de la dinámica del agua en la zona no saturada en un suelo sujeto a prácticas de conservación: implicaciones en la gestión de acuíferos y adaptación al cambio climático,"It is estimated that 80–85% of the water extracted from aquifers in Mexico is used for agricultural production, and in general, there is an inadequate management that causes different damages to the environment, highlighting the depletion and contamination of groundwater, among others. The purpose of this work is to quantify the water balance and dynamics in the unsaturated zone by means of daily measurements of different meteorological parameters and the moisture profiles of a soil that was treated to conservation practices in the Independence Aquifer (Upper La Laja River Basin tributary of the Lerma-Chapala). The stratigraphy of the site was obtained through continuous records of electrical conductivity and granulometry in unaltered soil samples - to which physical properties and organic matter content were determined - in their first 2.50 m depth. The changes in moisture content at 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90 and 1.20 m were controlled by Time Domain Refractometry (TDR). The saturated permeability was quantified with the Guelph Permeameter, complemented with infiltration tests. A one-dimensional numerical model was used to develop predictive tools. The results indicate that progressive capture of carbon occurred and that a saturated hydraulic conductivity of up to Kfs = 5 m∙d-1has been reached, in the first 0.60 m of depth, which contrasts up to two orders of magnitude with traditional soil management; allowing the gradual filtering of a total water sheet of 6,753 mm for three days, which would cover any sequence of maximum rainfall events recorded in the region. The RDT sensors showed a rapid increase in moisture content along the profile, indicating that the characteristics obtained in the soil allow the immediate input and storage of rainwater, with a minimum evaporation rate and zero runoff. The present work demonstrates that it is feasible to favor the infiltration of sufficient rainwater for the production of staple and fodder crops and to reduce the impacts of negative incidents because of climate change. This applies to irrigation crops, which would allow the progressive reduction of groundwater extraction, by more than 50%, through adequate conservation practices, a fundamental aspect in the management of the aquifer.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/430/416

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Palinoflora del Plioceno-Pleistoceno recuperada de los travertinos Villa Alegría y Cerro Prieto en el Valle de Tehuacán-Cuicatlán, México","Using standard methods, the Pliocene-Pleistocene paleopalynological assemblages recovered from both the Villa Alegría lacustrine sediments in northern Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley (TCV) and the Cerro Prieto travertine in the southern portion of the TCV exhibited high taxa diversity. Clear groupings of floristic elements were observed in cluster and multivariate principal components analysis (PCA), suggesting that during the Pliocene-Pleistocene the regional vegetation comprised cloud forest (possibly containing undergrowth rich in Cyatheaceae), pine-oak forest, gallery forest, mexical and tropical deciduous forest. For the Pleistocene, paleopalynological assemblages recovered from the Cerro Prieto travertine suggest that climatic conditions were slightly colder and more humid. The distribution of vegetation harbored by the TCV followed an altitudinal moisture gradient caused by the topography. Based on previous geological studies, the sedimentation environment inferred for Villa Alegría lacustrine sediments was a lake saturated in calcium carbonate sourced from the Sierra Mazateca, while that of the Cerro Prieto travertine was a flood zone in which carbonate-saturated waters from the Zapotitlán Formation accumulated. Based on biozone abundance, strong correlation between Villa Alegría lacustrine sediments and the Cerro Prieto travertine was observed.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/461/418

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Rock deterioration in the masonry walls of the Cathedral Basilica of Aguascalientes, Mexico","High porosity volcanic tuffs were used to elaborate the masonry of the walls of the Cathedral of Aguascalientes City, at central México. At present, masonry stones show evidences of deterioration, mainly in the lower part of the walls outside the building due to a raising moisture effect and environmental pollution which are causing damages such as flaking, scaling and black crusts. Petrological studies including X-Ray diffractometry and petrophysical analysis as porosity, density and bulk-density determinations as well stone damages survey were carried out to get information on the used rock types to elaborate the masonry walls, their petrological characteristics and physical harms. No compresional testings were developed due to scarse of stone samples, but there are reported data for these stones by others authors. The results allow to identify the stone type most prone to deteriorate, the mechanism of stone deterioration, and the factors accelerating deterioration. Although results have a pragmatic use for restoration works of the Cathedral of Aguascalientes City, the methodology applied could be used for determining the stone vulnerability to deteriorate in heritage buildings anywhere abroad.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/466/419

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Morphometric analysis of river basins using GIS and remote sensing of an Andean section of Route 150, Argentina. A comparison between manual and automated delineation of basins","A morphometric analysis using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing tools was performed to study the Agua Negra River basin, in the Central Andes of western Argentina. Well-delineated drainage basin boundaries are a critical factor in numerous natural resources studies such as flood assessment, water-usage, basin protection, preservation, planning, and resources management. In spite of their advantages, morphometry and automatic delineation of basins have rarely been applied in western Argentina. Through such an approach, the current study has successfully used computer-assisted methods and digital elevation models to delineate 17 basins through which a section of International 150 road passes. The resulting automated delineations were later compared with digital-manual delineations made with digital satellite imagery and topographic maps. The computer-assisted delineation compared very well to the digital-manual delineations, generally following drainage divides. The work load (including reprocessing and editing) was sharply decreased with the DEM computer-assisted delineating method, because digitally derived polygonal sub-basins areas were delineated in shorter times than those of the conventional manual method. Statistically, the absolute difference between computer-assisted and manually-derived basin area delineations was 5.29 percent, in average, on a range of 0.50 – 13.83 percent. In addition, a peak discharge analysis has been done as well. The slight differences in some results were irrelevant, when realizing the amount of resources and time saved with the automated techniques.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/482/420
