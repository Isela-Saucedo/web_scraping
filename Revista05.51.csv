Since second generation ethanol production from lignocellulosic material has become a hot topic of research due to its noncompetitive nature with food, economically feasible conversion of lignocellulosic biomass requires an organism capable of metabolizing both the hexoses and pentoses simultaneously.Saccharomyceswhich is in extensive use currently for bioethanol production can effectively convert hexoses into ethanol but unable to metabolize xylose. However,Wickerhamomyceshave the potential to convert both the pentoses as well as the hexoses into bioethanol. Additionally, due to its glycosidase production ability,Wickerhamomycesis tolerant to high levels of glucose and ethanol. Furthermore, the capabilities of the two genera with respect to their role in probiotics, antimicrobial agents, food, beverages, biosorption, whole cell biocatalyst, and pectinolytic enzyme production have also been compared in this review.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/379/190

Furthermore, it was evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the obtained extracts. For the above, a CSC was established successfully, producing a maximum of 15.2 g L-1of dry biomass at 12 days of culture. The production of FET, FLT and antioxidant activity (DPPH or ABTS) were related with culture growth and its maximum values were produced between 12 and 16 days of culture. The results showed that CSC yielded more FET, FLT and showed higher antioxidative activity than the wild plant. The methanolic and acetone extracts from wild plant showed inhibition of the edema induced by TPA in ear mice at 2 mg/ear, with 44.49 ± 10.75 % and 27.83 ± 9.59 % of inhibition, respectively, while the dichloromethane extract of CSC showed 39.41 ± 7.74 % of inhibition at 2 mg/ear and the positive control (indomethacin) 42.30  ± 4.46 % of inhibition at 0.5 mg/ear. It is the first time that a CSC establishment ofC. brasiliensehas been reported and its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity were demonstrated. The CSC reported here can be used as a bioresource to obtain extracts or bioactive compounds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/476/191

Spectrophotometric methods can be used for the quantification of mixtures, associated with chemometric tools, enabling the analysis of overlapping signals. The aim of this work is to apply the multivariate calibration with PLS (partial least squares) and artificial neural network (ANN), to estimate the concentration of esters in the transesterification of soybean oil using molecular absorption spectrophotometry as analytical technique. Absorbance measurements were performed in a spectrophotometer UV/VIS. Synthetic solutions were prepared with standards of the five major compounds of soybean biodiesel and real samples were obtained by the reaction of transesterification of soybean oil with NaOH and enzymatic method was used Lipozyme® IM (Novozymes), as catalysts. Results shows that all components of this reaction medium absorb in the wavelength range of 190-280 nm. Reactions of basic catalysis reached conversions close to 100%, while enzymatic reactions reached lower conversions. For both methods, calibration and validation groups were composed, respectively, by synthetic and real samples. Results showed that the concentrations of esters estimated by ANN model in the real samples are more accurate (R2-0.93), showing the good ability to estimation of ANN.","M.

In the new method, substrate-microorganism relationships are represented using the Contois equation rather than the first order models previously used to represent substrates in the degradation process. This model was validated by assessing the biogas production from the co-digestion of vegetable (V) and manure (M) with variations in the V/M ratio in the feed. The highest biogas and yield levels were obtained when the feed ratio was 50/50 V/M. This finding was reproduced by running simulations of the original and modified ADM1. The original ADM1 explains the low digestibility and utilization of manure for biogas production as a consequence of a slow disintegration or hydrolysis stage, which depends exclusively on the disintegration and hydrolysis constants used. The new model offers a more mechanistic explanation; it assumes unfavorable substrate-microorganism relationships, which cause disintegration to become a limiting factor in the process. In addition, biogas production in the new model is primarily associated with carbohydrate degradation, as well as low concentrations and rapid consumption of intermediary metabolites, which do not favor the proliferation of acetanogenic or methanogenic communities.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/557/199

Successful design was achieving when the culture medium ingredients and fermentation parameters were optimized to maximize the active enzyme content in raw extracts. The results showed that a starter inoculum containing 1.0 × 106 cells/mL mixed with a liquid culture medium supplemented with chitin (35.13 g/L), sodium chloride (27.53 g/L), magnesium chloride (42.71 g/L), sodium sulfate (1.71 g/L), calcium chloride (20.84 g/L), and yeast extract (5.1 g/L) in a stirred tank bioreactor under operating conditions held constant at 26.6 °C, 7.3 pH value, 96.8 rpm and 1.6 VVM allows for obtaining an enzyme preparation with an activity of 0.041 U/mL, which compares favorably against the yield achieved using the reference commercial culture medium and represent three-fold more units of enzyme as compared to those obtained at the shake flask level (0.026 U/mL). These results suggestV. alginolyticusis a strong candidate for producing active chitinases and confirm that the microbial ecology studies for specific microorganisms selection and the optimizing of both the culture medium and fermentation parameters (for the selected microorganism) allow evolve efficiently from the spontaneous to directed fermentations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/544/204

After 550 and 600 MPa treatments for 16 and 12 min, respectively, pitaya juice was stored 60 d at 4±1°C. No aerobic mesophiles were found immediately after HHP treatments, and during storage, counts remained below 2 Log10CFU mL‑1. In HHP‑treated juice, yeast and molds were undetectable and remained so during storage. After HHP treatments and during storage, no changes were observed in total soluble solids (9.8‑10.0 °Bx), luminosity (4.3‑4.4 %), and chroma (18.9-20.7). Depending on treatment condition, HHP lowered PME activity by 59-63 %. A further reduction reaching 25 % was observed after storage. Acidity, phenolic compounds, betalains concentrations, and antioxidant activity were not affected by HHP but a 43, 10, 14, and 5 % decrease, respectively, was observed after 60 d of storage. Finally, sensorial acceptability of juices was not affected by HHP but increased during storage reflecting an increased sweetness perception associated with lower acidity values. HHP is thus a viable alternative to produce non-acidified pitaya juice with a 60‑d refrigerated distribution shelf life.",V. S.

For the Fickian mechanism, the exponent (n) is ≤0.50, and non-Fickian is 0.5<n<1 for slabs. Moisture releases showed a Fickian mechanism form tortilla chips with lime (n= 0.5) due to water interaction with matrix components and non-Fickian for tortilla chips without lime (n= 0.6). Oil absorption showed a Fickian mechanism for nixtamalization with limen= 0.4 and for nixtamalization without lime, one ofn= 0.3. The larger water diffusion coefficient in the tortilla chip compared to that of oil diffusion indicates that water release and oil absorption during frying is not a simultaneous event. The behavior of the water and oil diffusion is an interesting topic that, in this study, was investigated using a practical equation with potential application in food processing.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/605/260

The influence of iron precipitation using the ferrocyanide treatment on the measured concentration of two model molecules (phthalic acid and meropenem) was studied. For this purpose, different solutions of phthalic acid and meropenem were prepared. Ferrous sulfate was added to the solutions after the adjustment of the pH value. Then, iron was removed by alkalization (traditional) and ferrocyanide treatments, this for phthalic acid. In the case of meropenem, the removal of iron was performed using only the ferrocyanide treatment due to a chemical modification of the molecule at (highly) alkaline conditions. According to the results, the application of ferrocyanide treatment did not affect the measurement of the concentration of phthalic acid and meropenem after the removal of iron. Moreover, some considerations are provided to apply this method to other molecules.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/545/207

However, acidic mordenite suffers from a fast deactivation (coking) that has not been properly studied. In the present work, we study the regeneration of the catalyst in several cycles aiming to help the future industrial application of mordenite catalysts in MA production. Both diluted and pure air have been successfully tested for the regeneration of the catalyst. The results show that 1) there is no negative effect after several regeneration cycles and 2) there is a slight improvement of catalyst productivity after the first regeneration cycle. A possible explanation to these results, which is highlighted in this work, is that the catalyst structure is not affected during regeneration while there is an initial migration of Al from the mordenite structure to extra-framework positions.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/477/223

To use this formula, the Darcy´s hydraulic friction factor must be known. The best approximation for the Darcy´s friction coefficient in turbulent flow regime, is expressed by the Colebrook-White equation. This equation can only be solved by numerical methods, because it is implicit for the friction coefficient. There are other approximate explicit models for the calculation with different relative errors in comparison to the Colebrook-White equation. In this work, a review of the friction factor explicit correlations is made including, for the first time in an article of this type, 48 equations, 10 of them that had not been reported previously and other explicit equations whose precision does not agree with previous reports or had not been included in review articles on this topic.

This protein has biological activity, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Several methods have been proposed to separate Lf from whey, including ultrafiltration or chromatography affinity. In this work, extraction of Lf was proposed, which was carried out using a matrix of polyacrylamide (PAM) activated with Cu (II) to improve its affinity to lactoferrin. Matrices were prepared with two different %T concentrations (6 and 10); these were characterized, and PAM 10%T showed higher entropy values (higher homogeneity), therefore, it was modified with cupric ion and used in the subsequent extraction stages. FT-IR and SEM analysis supported the functionalization of matrix PAM 10%T; likewise, the role of the copper ion in the extraction procedure. According to SDS-PAGE results, PAM (10%T)-IDA-Cu2+-imidazole enabled to reach a lactoferrin recovery around 82.5%; besides, a Lf-enriched fraction (150 µg per gram of powder) was obtained.

One of the alternatives used in this work is biosorption, for which an agroindustrial waste (epidermis fromAgave atrovirens) was used to evaluate the affinity of removal of lead and copper in aqueous solutions; in addition, spectroscopy and microscopy techniques were used to elucidate and corroborate the removal and affinity capacity of the agave epidermis for both metals studied. The optimal pH value for the removal of both metals was 3. The adsorption isotherms yielded a qmaxof 25.7 and 8.6 mg/g for lead and copper, respectively. Adjusting to the Langmuir-Freundlich model, the adsorption kinetics were pseudo-second order, and it was found that the equilibrium time was at 140 min.

The effect of the reactor operating conditions (water type, addition of inoculum, phenanthrene concentration of 112 mg L-1, and air flow of 1.5 L min-1) and variations in phenanthrene concentration (60, 200, and 600 mg L-1at an air flow of 2 L min-1) were evaluated. Phenanthrene degradation was improved when an inoculum was added to the seawater (62.5%–69.5% of the initial concentration was degraded); the best microbial growth was observed when an inoculum was added to sterile seawater (constant concentration) and when phenanthrene concentration was 200 mg L-1; however, the highest degradation rate values (mg CFU-1) were obtained for a phenanthrene concentration of 600 mg L-1. Operating conditions and phenanthrene concentration had significant impacts on phenanthrene degradation and microbial growth (P < 0.05). The findings show that the FBR efficiency in phenanthrene degradation responds to a multi factorial operating conditions; however, high efficiencies can be reached if the operating conditions, including inoculum addition, are carefully controlled.","C.

The bioadsorbents were placed in contact with the solution of Cr (VI) at pH 2 and 100 ppm, taking samples at different times until equilibrium. The kinetics were adjusted to the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and Elovich models. It was established that: the increase in temperature favours the process for the plantain peel and decreases the capacity of adsorption for oil palm bagasse; and that a decrease in the amount of adsorbent favours the kinetics for both biomasses studied. The Elovich model describes the behaviour for the plantain peel, while the pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order models do it for the oil palm bagasse when the temperature varies. The Elovich model better approximates the kinetic data by varying the adsorbent dose of both biomasses, suggesting that the process of adsorption of Cr (VI) was controlled by chemisorption.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/650/259

The irradiation doses and pH levels affected (p< 0.05) the elimination of coliforms and aerobic mesophilic microorganisms with the same efficiency as TT. Molds and yeasts were successfully eliminated at doses ≥24.2 mJ×cm-2regardless of pH. Reducing sugars, total polyphenols, and aloin A content decreased as pH increased (p< 0.05).

TEM microscopy indicates that mechanical agitation produced ~ 33% particles with diameter between 15-20 nm, while magnetic stirring formed 29% (12.12% less). The sizes range obtained for both agitations types was 10 to 45 nm, with the predominant size being 15 to 20 nm. The FTIR spectrometry analysis revealed that the nFC obtained are analogous to those reported in the literature. Ζeta potential values of -20 mV to -14 mV were obtained for mechanical and magnetic agitation respectively, suggesting that nFC synthesized by mechanical agitation is more stable in solution. The results obtained reveal that mechanical agitation improves the characteristics of the nanocomposite, so this technique should be validated.

Also, a compatibilizer based on glycidyl methacrylate and PLA was used to enhance the fiber-PLA interaction. The results showed that crystallinity of PLA was increased with nanoclay addition while fiber inclusion decreased it. Tensile and flexural moduli were increased by both reinforcements. The agave fibers affect negatively the tensile and flexural strengths, but they were importantly recovered by the used of the compatibilizer. Even though the nanoclay did not modify the impact strength, it was increased with agave fiber addition. The water absorption results showed that the coupling agent decreases the rate and maximum water absorption of the biocomposites. In general, it was concluded that with a proper combination of both reinforcers (hybridization) and the compatibilizer, it is possible to control the final characteristics of the biocomposite according to the desired or potential applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/627/272

The materials used were zeolite Y in its protonic (HY) and sodic (NaY) form. The interaction between thiophene and the zeolitic material was performed by the adsorption of thiophene at room temperature using a solution of thiophene inn-octane (100-700 ppmw), leading to the formation of cationic thiophene oligomers that are trapped inside the cavities of HY, among other non-oligomeric species. The thiophene-zeolite Y interaction occurs through the Brönsted acid sites by two possible routes:i)by electrophilic attack to the pair of free electrons in sulfur, forming oligothiophene whose size is limited by the structure of zeolite and,ii)by interaction with the α-carbon that leads to the formation of thiols and hydrocarbons with carbons with sp3and H2S hybridization.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/617/273

A CA model of two agents’ chemical kinetics has been optimized earlier using NSGA-II based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). But the stochastic nature of the CA model along with its high sensitivity on the model parameters requires extensive investigation using different optimization algorithms. For this purpose, in the current study, four more recently developed and popular optimization algorithms based on GA, called NSGA-IIr, NSGA-IIa, AbYSS, and MOEA/D, have been considered for investigation based on various performance measuring parameters. The study also compares the performances of the algorithms for different computational efforts with an objective to minimize the required number of objective function evaluations. Simulation results show NSGA-IIr as the best choice to optimize the CA model for 75000 objective function evaluations. Such results facilitate the use of stochastic CA models to represent complex (bio)-chemical networks.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/395/213

The SA of a model allows to determine how uncertainties in the model responses (outputs) can be assigned to the values of the model parameters (input variables). The related literature indicates that there are several methods to perform SA. This work addresses the benchmarking of four widely used methods for Global SA (GSA): Sobol-Jansen, Sobol-Baudin, Sobol-Owen and Sobol 2007, based on the concept of performance profile introduced by Dolan and Moré (2002) and the extension by Mahajan et al. (2012). For the previous methods, a set of 21 models and their variations were considered, which correspond to various applications in chemical engineering (such as heap leaching, water distribution network, milling, flotation circuit, among others). These comparisons show that the Sobol-Jansen method has the best performance profile because it is the first to perform GSA in 83% of the models considered. The four SA methods analyzed proved to be quite stable since they performed the SA in 100% of the models tested.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/547/264
