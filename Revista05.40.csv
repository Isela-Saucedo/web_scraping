Recently, the demand for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been increasing exponentially, since their potential for therapeutic use was disclosed and improved techniques to produce them at higher titers have become available. Although upstream processing of mAbs has suffered a tremendous improvement, in the last decades, the downstream processing has been considered the bottleneck in providing antibodies at reliable costs, being, in fact, the major cost factor with 50 to 80% of total production costs. Therefore, alternative methods for mAbs’s purification may be required. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have been described, for the last decade, as a viable alternative to the current establish platform, since clarification, concentration and purification can be achieved in just one step using a biocompatible environment. Therefore, the use of ATPS for integrative purification of mAbs it will be reviewed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1325/572

In this context, different purification techniques, that offer both high recovery and purity to the final product, have been assayed by different research groups. Liquid-liquid extraction with aqueous two-phase systems is one of the most studied methodologies for bio-separation. This technique presents several advantages such as mild conditions of working, cost-effectiveness, short-time consumption and high recovery percentage of the final product. With the aim to present a comparison of liquid-liquid extractions with other techniques, several aqueous two-phase extraction processes of biomolecules are presented in this review. We presented the advantages and disadvantages of them as of the compared systems. In general, the highest final product purities are achieved when different methodologies are combine, being the chromatographic ones the most applied in the last stages for the high purification factor obtained after them. Alternative methodologies, such as aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), i.e., PEG/salts or ionic liquids; aqueous two-phase micellar systems, using solvents and surfactants; and extractive fermentation with ATPS, are relevant for both cost-effectiveness and time-saving of the purification process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1326/573

Supplemented IMDM roller bottle cultures of CD34+cells from human umbilical cord blood were established for hematopoietic progenitor expansion. The maximum total colony forming cells (CFC) expansion was achieved after 5 days of culture, being 16.94±2.82 folds in roller bottles and 17.28±4.47 in static cultures. However, the maximum total cell fold expansion was attained after 10 days of culture. It was of 20.31±6.18 for the roller bottles and 26.45±9.89 for the static cultures. The efficacy of the roller bottles system for short-term cultures of CD34+cells and expanding hematopoietic progenitors in IMDM was demonstrated; encouraging the use of this culture system for other experiments and may be used for future clinical applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1327/574

In this study, the use of xylose and glucose for the production of plasmid DNA (pDNA) was tested using the engineered strain E. coli PTS−GalP+∆(recA, deoR). Growth rate and acetate production were similar using glucose or xylose as the carbon source, but pDNA yield (YP/x) was lower in cultures with xylose. However, when both carbon sources were coutilized, growth rate increased by 39 %, and YP/xrecovered, consequently increasing the specific pDNA production rate by 28 %. Therefore, the used of glucose-xylose mixtures is an attractive alternative for pDNA production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1328/575

The 16s rDNA sequence analysis allowed to identify KJ629314 as a strain of Bacillus sp. Experimental phase was conducted to assess the aerobic biodegradation of diesel; to determine the removal efficiency and the corresponding microbial growth; diesel was used as a substrate - electron donor - carbon source; and oxygen (via aeration) as the electron acceptor. Tests were conducted in microcosms with sterile sand with nutrients according to the Nitrogen:Phosphorus ratio of 15:1 at different diesel concentrations (10,000; 20,000; 30,000; 40,000 and 50,000 mg/kg soil). Results showed that the strain of Bacillus sp KJ629314 has a high potential in the biodegradation of diesel at the evaluated concentrations, and it was demonstrated that the removal efficiency was greater at low concentrations of diesel obtaining higher values for the microbial growth and diesel biodegradation rate constants. These promising results support the fact that Bacillus sp KJ629314 may be used as a novel biological resource to develop a bioprocess for the bioremediation of diesel-contaminated soil.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1329/576

The results obtained indicated that the bioanode clones were related with the phyla: Firmicutes (15.3%), Proteobacteria (7.6%), Bacteroidetes (30.7%), and Ignavibacteriae (7.6%). Conversely, the biocathode clones were related with the phylum Proteobacteria (38.4%). The bioanode clones were related with species identified previously in MECs and Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). However, the biocathode clones were related with Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which have not been reported for hydrogen production by MEC.

C. flavigena has the ability to grow on carbon sources that are not derived from lignocellulosic wastes such as lactose, sucrose and raftilose. In this study, when C. flavigena was cultured on lactose and sucrose, the cell production was approximately 2 mg/mL, and when was cultured on raftilose, it reached 1 mg/mL. The hydrolytic activity of β-galactosidase and β-fructofuranosidase enzymes were tested in the intra and extra cellular fractions where the highest activity was found in the intracellular fraction using raftilose as substrate, nevertheless using lactose as substrate the activity was significantly low. The protein profiles of the intracellular extracts presented great quantity of bands in the different substrates used as carbon sources of carbon. Probably the synthesis of intracellular enzymes is not regulated and the cell expresses its whole potential. In addition the presence of the gene β-galactosidase was identified.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1353/595

EN LA REMOCIÓN DE COBRE (II) EN MODELOS DE AGUA POR AGLOMERACIÓN ESFÉRICA,"El cobre en agua constituye un micronutriente esencial para el humano, pudiendo producir, por exceso, efectos perjudiciales para la salud. En ambientes acuáticos naturales, la toxicidad de este elemento está atribuida a la especie divalente Cu(II). La técnica de aglomeración esférica destaca para remover cobre en agua, empleando agentes tensoactivos industriales con alto contenido ´ de sodio (Na). En este estudio se desarrolló un método de remoción de Cu(II) en modelos de agua (2-15 ppm) por aglomeración esférica, utilizando como biosurfactante extractos de pulpa de lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla Torr.), rica en saponinas, libre de sodio, y constituye un subproducto en varias agroindustrias de México. Las condiciones experimentales fueron: 0.1-2 g-extracto/g de metal, T°=22°C, pHInicial= 8.0 y agitación constante de 600 rpm. Las saponinas en el extracto se identificaron por HPLC-DAD, comparando los tiempos de retención de los picos característicos contra un estándar. El cobre y sodio residuales se determinaron por espectroscopia de absorción atómica. Una eficiencia media (98.7%) obtenida en los experimentos realizados para remover cobre, que satisface las normas para agua potable y para descarga a cuerpos de agua, nos permite recomendar la sustitución de agentes tensoactivos industriales por extractos de lechuguilla (A. lechuguilla), en la remoción de Cu (II) en agua por la técnica de aglomeración esférica.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1356/597

The adsorption isotherms of the microcapsules and the minimum integral entropy (∆Sint)T were determined at 25, 35 and 40 ◦C. The glass transition temperature (T g) was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and modeled by GordonTaylor equation. The water contents-water activity (M-aW) sets obtained from (∆Sint)T , and critical water content (CWC) and critical water activity (CWA) from the T g were similar, being in the range of water content of 5.11-7.5 kg H2O/100 kg d.s. and in the water activity range of 0.532-0.590. These critical storage conditions were considered as the best conditions for increase the stability of the microcapsules, where the percentage of retention Betanin in the microcapsules was higher compared with other storage conditions in the temperature and aw range studied.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1330/577

For method standardization, reference materials and ingredients were used. Carbohydrate distribution was based in their separation by Ultrafiltration through 3 kDa membrane, allowing separation and quantification of long-chain fructans (degree of polymerization DP>10) from short-chain fructans (FOS DP<10). The relation of long-chain fructans versus short-chain fructans (long:short) resulted in 52-60:40-48 for Agave materials showing almost the same relation as the chicory ingredients. The retention factor (Rf) of each band band by HPTLC from each sample was recorded and compared to generate a characteristic chicory an Agave profile. The bands of fructose, sucrose, 1-kestone and in the agave materials. It was possible to differentiate between sources of fructans, since the band profiles were different.

VARIETY","The effect of the moisture content (55, 60 and 65% (w/w)) and temperature (30, 40 and 50 °C) on the X-ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural, pasting, thermal and rheological properties of nixtamalized dough (masa) from a corn hybrid variety (Zea mays sp.) is reported. A complete set of rheological tests including temperature and frequency sweeps, steady shear and transient shear flow was performed in order to get detailed information on the food processing issues. The nixtamalization process affected significantly (P < 0.05) the microstructural and thermal properties of masa. Polarized Light microscopy and XRD showed that crystallinity in starch granules decreased for the masa; whereas, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), showed swollen granules dispersed into a plasticized surface. Moreover, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed significant (P < 0.05) differences on the gelatinization enthalpy (∆Hgel) of masa, where it increased with increasing the moisture content from 6.7 ± 0.84 J/g for 55% (w/w) to 10.2 ± 0.4 J/g for 60% (w/w). Frequency sweeps showed a predominant elastic behavior where the storage modulus (G´) was higher than the loss modulus (G´´) and they were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the moisture content and temperature into a small range. The steady shear data exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior and followed a power law equation, where the power law index (n) decreased when the temperature and the moisture content increased. The effect of temperature on the shear-viscosity (η) was well described by the Arrhenius equation, exhibiting energy activation energy (Ea) values in the range from 25.52 to 59.35 KJ/mol. For transient shear test, all masas presented a stress overshoot at high shear rate before reaching a steady state. It was found that the amplitude of this overshoot depends on the shear rate. On the other hand, the stress relaxation test, which gives the main relaxation time (τ), showed fast relaxation decay at short times, whereas at long times, a slow relaxation was observed. The τ values ranged from 10.46 to 0.43 s, which decreased with increasing shear rate. The rheological behavior of masa was related to a weak gel-like structure formation, composed by dispersed swollen starch granules into a cross-linked starch network, similar to a biocomposite material.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1335/579

URBAN),"Yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus L. Urban) solids (YS) were used at concentrations of 3, 5 and 7 % w/w for stabilizing oil-inwater emulsions with a 0.15 mass fraction (E3, E5and E7). Higher YS concentrations produced emulsions with smaller average particle size distribution, more marked shear thinning behaviour, and higher solid-like (tan δ < 1) viscoelastic properties. Optical micrographs revealed that the rheological properties, particle size distribution, and stability of the emulsions were predominantly associated to the formation of 3-D particles network in the continuous phase that immobilized the emulsion droplets. The micrographs also showed small sized YS fragments adsorbed at the oil-water interface, contributing with a steric stabilization term to emulsions stability. Variations in the rheological properties of the emulsions with aging time (14 days) were less pronounced when using higher YS concentrations.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1336/581

To dough with a dough yield (DY) of 150 were added 50 mL of inoculum (109CFUmL−1) and fermented at 35°C for 24 h (76% RH). The uniaxial extensibility of the dough was determined at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h of fermentation using a texture analyzer equipped with a Kieffer rig. The microstructure was observed by means of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and the images were analyzed to determine the fractal dimension (FDS DBC) and Entropy (Ent). In all cases, the maximum extensibility (Em) and the maximum resistance (Rm) of the doughs decreased with the progress of fermentation. Lb. plantarum and Lb. sanfranciscensis reduced Em by 40 and 42%, respectively, while DY decreased by more than 85%. Fermentation increased the structural complexity of the dough by raising its FDS DBC and Ent values, with differences depending on the type of bacteria. These results provide adequate criteria for the selection of bacteria for the development of sourdoughs and for understanding the structural and mechanical changes that occur during fermentation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1337/582

The aim of this paper is to propose a continuous process for biodiesel production using a continuous flow tubular reactor (CFTR) using vegetable oil, methanol and a alkaline catalyst, whose application will reduce operating costs, maintenance and production time. Tests were conducted inside an industrial reactor’s heating coil to obtain the reaction kinetics and to evaluate the equipment’s energy transfer with different heating fluids. The design parameters were considered to obtain a biodiesel production of 500 tons per month in a continuous flow tubular reactor with nonlinear geometry, a conversion in one step greater than 99%, temperatures between 60 and 75 ° C, with recovery of methanol and obtaining glycerin as a commercial by-product.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1339/584

Phenanthrene, naphthalene and benzene derivates were found as the most common hydrocarbon contaminants present in underwater sinkholes located in Cancún and Playa del Carmen, two well-developed tourism poles. Other regions of Quintana Roo, with intermediate tourism development (Puerto Morelos, Tulum, Cozumel and Bacalar) show hydrocarbon presence too. In comparison, Holbox which is a recent touristic development where the use of motor transportation for tourists and locals is less common, has not reached the contamination level of Cancún or Playa del Carmen nor the pollution level of intermediate tourism development poles as Tulum or Cozumel.

Nejayote contains a high concentration of organic matter (20 to 30 g COD L−1), a considerable amount of Ca2+and PO4−2as well as several nutrients. This work consists of assessing basically two issues. The first is the granular sludges methane production by diluting the nejayote with municipal wastewater of different organic loads. The second is the calcium effect over granular sludges by its precipitation through CO2bubbling. The most important results show first, more than twenty times methanogenic activity reduction without Ca2+remotion. Second, COD removal efficiences turned beyond than 90%.

This cell consisted of four pairs of chambers with a volume of 0.5 L each one of them, separated by a Nafion®117 membrane. The cell was monitored during 122 days, using synthetic wastewater as carbon source. The reduction of cation exchange capacity in the membrane was evaluated in two phases: 1 and 2, the first one at 43 days and the second one at 79 days. The cationic exchange coefficients obtained were 2.03 ×10−3and 1.25 ×10−3meq g−1polymer, for phase 1 and 2 respectively, indicating a decrease in the cation exchange properties in the membrane. The maximum obtained power densities were 325 and 97 mW.m−3, respectively. The reduction of power density at phase 2 was attributed to a decrease in the cation-exchange capacity by iron fouling and a formation of a biofouling layer in the membrane.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1347/590

The main objective in this work was to elucidate when these approaches should be coupled to a pseudo-heterogeneous fixed-bed adsorber model to describe reliable breakthrough curves when experimental data at industrial scale are not available. To achieve this, an adsorption column packed with a low-cost natural zeolite was modelled for the removal of Rhodamine B (RhB). To have certainty in the model predictions, equilibrium and kinetic experiments were carried out. Freundlich isotherm model and a pseudo second order apparent kinetic model accounting for diffusion phenomena led to the most adequate fit to experimental data. Experimental and simulations results indicated that the use of an isotherm model (LDF-M) or an apparent kinetic model (AkA-M) in the packed bed adsorbed model predicted similar tendencies regarding the effect on the breakthrough point of the different parameters considered. Nevertheless, the shapes of the breakthrough curves predicted by both models were significantly different, suggesting that an apparent kinetic model is necessary to have reliable prediction of the industrial behaviour of this studied zeolite since intraparticle mass transport resistances are significant.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1348/591

Particles of approximately 14 and 40 nm were evaluated. For this purpose, we used a magnetic induction system to obtain the specific absorption rate (SAR) values. Two different amplitudes of 35 mT and 63 mT at 180 kHz were used. Our results showed the smaller particles exhibiting the higher SAR value, independent of the intensities applied. Moreover, there was no significant change in the SAR values for both particle sizes in presence of silica. However, silica increased the hydrolytic degradation.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1350/592

This material was analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis, electron microscopy (SEM-TEM), and IR-spectroscopy among others. The results indicated that the studied mineral is a clay type 1:1, mineralogically classified as meta-halloysite. XRF and XRD showed composition and structure profiles of a scientifically and technologically valuable mineral due to the absence of contaminants in significant quantities. TEM analysis revealed halloysite nanotubes with 80 to 600 nm of length, and the nitrogen adsorption showed a mesoporous solid with specific surface area of 43 m2/g.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1351/593

Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics were determined of the sludge, elemental analysis (C, H, O, N and S) heavy metal content. The Lower Heating Value (LHV) and the High Heating Value (HHV) were determined for evaluation as an energy source, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry to determine the behavior of the sludge when subjected to different temperatures. Data generated in the characterization of sludge were used in the simulation and this was carried out by Aspen Plus. Cold gas efficiency (ηCGE) of 88.79% was obtained by gasifying with oxygen in contrast to the 71.9% ηCGE by gasifying with air. Costs are reduced in sludge drying process to gasify with a content of 30% humidity with air and 10% humidity with oxygen. According to the characteristics of sludge and simulation results, it was concluded that the sludge from the wastewater treatment plant are suitable for use as a source of alternative energy.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1357/598

APPLICATION TO (BIO)CHEMICAL REACTORS,"A new criterion of measurement was proposed to determine the representation of a linearized system with respect to nonlinear system. This criterion is based on the Taylor series expansion of nonlinear system and was applied to three (bio)chemical reactors including the Cholette’s bioreactor with multiple inputs, outputs and steady states; a reactor with enzymatic reaction and a chemical reactor. Current approach considers that matrix elements resulting from left division of matrices containing second-order and first-order partial derivatives should be smaller than deviations from the nominal values. With this analysis, is possible to determine the influence of each bifurcation parameter on the nonlinear system for simulation and control applications.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1358/599
