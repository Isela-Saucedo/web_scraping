Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Diversity of the Crinocheta (Crustacea, Isopoda, Oniscidea) from Early Miocene Chiapas amber, Mexico","Currently, the Onisicdea (terrestrial isopods) is a massive Crustacea suborder of more than 3 700 species, but our knowledge of their paleodiversity is poor. In this paper, we present ten fossils of Crinocheta, the largest clade within the Onisicdea, discovered in Early Miocene (23 Ma) amber of Chiapas. We described three new genera and six new species includingPalaeolibrinus spinicornisgen. nov. sp. nov.,Armadilloniscus miocaenicussp. nov.,Archeostenoniscus robustusgen. nov. sp. nov.,Archeostenoniscus mexicanussp. nov.,Palaeospherarmadillo mazanticusgen. nov. sp. nov., andPalaeospherarmadillo rotundussp. nov. This study represents the first fossil record of the family Detonidae, Olibrinidae, and “Stenoniscidae”. From a paleoenvironmental reconstruction perspective, the oniscidean fauna presented here supports a particularly wet paleoenvironment, under brackish water influence, similar to an estuary.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/639/907

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Landslide inventory in the lower basin of Blanco River (31ºS), central Andes of Argentina","We introduce the first landslides inventory made in the lower basins of Río Blanco, San Juan province, Argentina. The prehistoric events were recognized through interpretation of diverse satellite images. The obtained results were verified during field trips to terrain and digitalized via a geographical information system (QGIS). After a detailed geomorphological map was made, around 800 mass removal processes were identified, which takes up to 30 % of the study area. The recognized mass removal processes were falls, flows, slides, rock avalanches and soligelifluction. It was also noticed that almost all mapped events and scars are located over the 3000 m a.s.l. The active events tend to be originated in the periglacial environment with evidence of glacier activity in the past. This represents a new challenge in a global warming perspective where permafrost is being degraded.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/787/908

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Crustal structure of the eastern Acambay Graben, central Mexico, from integrated geophysical data","The Acambay graben is a ∼70 km long E–W seismically active structure located within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). Quaternary volcanism has contributed to shaping the graben morphology and reported hydrothermal activity suggests the existence of potential geothermal reservoirs. Our work aims at providing information about the unstudied subsurface structure of the graben using magnetotelluric (MT) soundings, as well as gravity and aeromagnetic data as preliminary work for near-future integrated 3D approach. We analyzed the distribution of magnetic anomalies and its relation to faulting using total field (TFM) aeromagnetic digital charts E14 and F14 (https://www.gob.mx/sgm) and through the analysis of the tilt derivative of TFM. The gravity and magnetic horizontal derivatives provided complementary results to constrain the location of the main fault and to contrast the response of the Pastores and Acambay-Tixmadejé faults. For the subsurface interpretation, we present the results of a 25 km magnetotelluric (MT) profile across the eastern tip of the Acambay graben, oriented approximately perpendicular to the azimuth of the main ∼E–W fault systems. The resulting resistivity model incorporates gravity and aeromagnetic coincident model profiles. Density and magnetic susceptibility models were constrained with field sample data, surface geology and with the resistivity structure obtained from the 2D inversion of the measured MT soundings. The dimensionality and electric strike of the 13 MT stations that compose the profile were analyzed for a period band of 0.01 to 100 s. The average electric azimuth obtained was 88.5°±10°, which was used to invert the rotated to the electric strike MT profile. The integrated geophysical model reveals important lithological contrasts at the northern and southern bounding faults of the graben. While the northern Acambay-Tixmadejé fault affects a resistive ground and is associated to a >20 mGal gravity anomaly, the southern Pastores fault corresponds to a contrasting conductive zone with relatively low gravity anomaly (∼5 mGal). In contrast, the magnetic anomaly shows the opposite behavior; at the Pastores fault the observed amplitude is of 400 nT while the amplitude across the Acambay-Tixmadejé fault is insignificant. The geophysical model shows that both the Acambay-Tixmadejé and Pastores faults have constant and opposite dipping angles of about 70°, defining a nearly symmetric graben structure. According to our results, the Acambay-Tixmadejé fault as well as the central graben fault system converge at a depth of ∼18 km that is consistent with the depth of the seismogenic crustal layer.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/864/909
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Climate change impact assessment on a hydrologic basin under natural regime (SE, Spain) using a SWAT model","Currently, water demands are in continuous growth which increases the pressure, in quantity and quality, on the water resources available over the world. Likewise, the projected reduction of natural water inputs, due to climate change, represents a new level of uncertainty. Despite existing errors, hydrological models are important tools for planning and managing water resources. Their correct application is essential in areas with high water stress (arid and semi-arid regions). The Segura River basin district (DHS), southeastern Spain, has one of the highest scarcity rates and intensive exploitation of water resources in Europe and the world. This study estimates the effects of climate change on the main components of the water balance in the upper basin of the Taibilla River (the headwater of the DHS). This basin has been chosen because it is in natural regime and it is currently one of the main water supplies in many DHS municipalities and contiguous areas. In order to assess the mentioned effects, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) calibrated with the SUFI-2 algorithm. Calibration and validation were performed with two objective functions (NSE and KGE) in the period with availability of discharge data (1996-2012). The precipitation and temperature projections came from the global climate models (GCMs) bcc-csm1-1-m, MPI.ESM.MR and bcc.csm1.1, regionalized with the analogue technique, under the emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (period 2010-2050). The adjustment results improved with NSE, with respect to KGE, in the calibration and validation series. In the future decades, precipitation, surface runoff and recharge of aquifers would show negative trends while the temperature would increase by between 1.5 °C and 1.7 °C. In spite of the existing uncertainty, it is evident that natural water inputs will decrease in this river basin. This will be a challenge in the water resources management for local authorities. The obtained results can assist local authorities at decision making regarding hydrological planning and the fight against climate change in the DHS. In addition, SWAT as a rainfall-runoff conversion tool, together with the implemented models and climate change scenarios, are suitable in an area with subhumid and semi-arid climate and can be used in other regions with similar climatology.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/564/910
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Paleoambiental reconstruction of the Xochimilco sub-basin, central Mexico, between 18000 and 5000 years cal before present","We present a record of millennial-scale paleoenvironmental variations from a site in Xochimilco basin, central Mexico, between 18000 and 5000 years cal BP, using the magnetic mineralogy, geochemical elements content and diatom assemblages. The analyzed sedimentary sequence is chronologically constrained by the recognition of well-known tephra layers widely used as stratigraphical markers in the region: the Tutti Frutti Pumice from Popocatépetl stratovolcano (17070 years cal BP), and the Upper Toluca Pumice (12320 years cal BP) from the Nevado de Toluca, as well as a14C date from an ostracod rich horizon. The temporal variations recorded in magnetic susceptibility (χ), Fe oxides and oxyhydroxides (hematite and goethite), ultra-fine magnetic minerals, titanium, organic and inorganic carbon, and the iron/titanium, calcium/titanium, organic carbon/nitrogen, silicon/titanium ratios and diatom content indicate fluctuations in runoff, origin of magnetic minerals, salinity, productivity and sources of organic matter. These variations respond to millennial-scale climatic oscillations. The deglacial period (18000–11700 years cal BP) was characterized by intense volcanic activity, and the dominance of clastic sedimentation in a fresh water shallow lake. The Heinrich 1 (cold), Bølling/Allerød (warm) and Younger Dryas (cold) events, were recorded in the runoff, organic matter content and carbonate precipitation proxies. The driest conditions in all of the sequence were recorded during early Holocene (11700–8200 years cal BP). The return to more humid conditions and the establishing of a fresh water lake during the late mid Holocene (8200–5000 years cal BP), could promote the settling of communities on the lake shore.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/779/911

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Estimation of natural groundwater recharge in the Aguascalientes semiarid valley, Mexico","Groundwater recharge (GWR) is analyzed and evaluated within the Aguascalientes Valley by means of a modified linearized Boussinesq equation and the Water Table Fluctuations (WTF) technique. These techniques use the specific yield, water table variations and the subsurface drainage of groundwater. The methodology is applied to the semiarid Aguascalientes valley, which contains a thick vadose zone. The combination of the analytical solution based on the Boussinesq equation and the WTF technique, allows the method to be applied in areas with deep groundwater levels, such as the Aguascalientes valley, without the need for high temporal resolution data. The data for the application of the method were provided by various government agencies and includes information on 145 wells positioned within the valley during the period 1985-2015. The specific yield and the transmissivity were integrated from the results of two previous investigations. Results indicate that the variation of recharge ranges from 0.86 to 525.69 mm/year in the analyzed period, with the highest recharge rates occurring in the north and center parts of the valley and is likely attributed to high specific yield and vertical hydraulic conductivity due to the presence of coarse permeable soils present in the area. Conversely, the lowest recharge rates were found to occur near the north and south borders of the valley.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/1022/913
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Analogue model of gravity driven deformation in the salt tectonics zone of northeastern Mexico,"In the deep seated gravity-driven deformation systems of the Gulf of Mexico contemporaneous extension and contraction of the overburden is favored by mechanical decoupling from the basement along thick salt sequences (up to 4 km). The updip extension is located inland, on the continental shelf of northeast Mexico, and is characterized by extensional listric faults and roll-overs; the downdip shortening zone is located at the deep waters and is characterized by a fold and thrust belt detached above the salt layer. Two physical experiments are used to discuss some aspects of these gravity-driven systems. The experimental setup includes a motor-driven experimental table, an inclined brittle basement (1°), a silicone layer simulating the salt sequences, and sand layers simulating the pre-kinematic Jurassic-Cretaceous strata before Laramide shortening. Deformation resulted in further tilting of the basement (3° to 4°). After the onset of deformation, thin sand layers were added at regular time intervals simulating the syntectonic sedimentation. The experiments reproduced the geometry of the deformation at the frontal ramp characterized by a seaward vergent thrust and its associated deformed region (the Perdido fold belt). The fold and thrust belt localization was favored by the change in basement inclination (a built-in slope change). Key elements interpreted in one available section of the area were reproduced in the model: a) the presence of an antithethic roll-over in the extensional zone and, b) the basinward vergence of folds and thrusts observed in the downdip shortening zone in the mexican Perdido fold belt.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/739/914
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Coastal dynamics and anthropization in uruguayan beaches: an integrated analysis for its conservation,"Coastal environments are being affected on a global scale by excessive urbanization, industrial growth and tourism, which are causing erosion, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem alteration, constituting potential risks that entail negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences. In this sense, the Uruguayan coast, characterized by extensive sandy beaches separated by rocky promontories, is not excluded from to this global problem. Focusing on geomorphological, sedimentological and malacological aspects, we tackle the anthropic impact on littoral dynamics with the purpose of creating a database to evaluate different aspects related to the beach resource management. In this work, seven beaches from Maldonado Department were compared, one on which is on an estuarial environment while the others are on the Atlantic margin, and they all present different degrees of anthropization and urbanization. Each coastal zone (foreshore, backshore, dune and modified dune) was parameterized taking into account the area, width, slope and cross section through a geomorphological analysis, making use of satellite images, digital elevation models, and processing and storage of data in a geographic information system. The grain size analysis allowed the characterization of each site and coastal zone, and by statistics it was possible to establish a relationship between the increase of the standard deviation and the anthropization in the coastal strip. The faunal composition identified in the beaches and different index calculations showed the sites with the greatest diversity and dominance. The anthropization in the coastal strip is associated with incipient urban development, which modifies the dune sector generating a reduction of the coastal zones, exposing more vulnerable areas to littoral erosion. This results presented in this paper may contribute to a better management of the coastal environment and to identify critical zones.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/865/906
