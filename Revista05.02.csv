Fermentation kinetics were evaluated in cell buffer solution solid to liquid ratio 1:20 and sampling was performed every 8 h for 32 h. The highest cellular retention of RH pretreated with H2SO4(PretAcid) was at 24 h (98.35 mg g–1), while RH pretreated with NaOH (PretAlka), was at 16 h (63.21 mg g–1), meanwhile, the treatment that was not subjected to chemical treatment (Control), was at 24 h (8.56 mg g–1). On the other hand, the maximum support efficiency was reached at 36 h in the order of 44.99, 23.25 and 23.43 % for PretAcid, PretAlka and Control, respectively. These results indicate that due to the structural modification that RH underwent during chemical pretreatments, may be an ideal substrate for the adsorption of yeast cells.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2558/1285

One of these applications is the production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolysates at high temperature. Here, a new thermotolerant strain ofK. marxianus(Kmx24) was isolated from a cooked henequen core. Its tolerance to acetic acid, one of the most common fermentation inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, was examined. Growth and ethanol production from glucose by Kmx24 were inhibited at acetic acid concentrations > 1.5 g/L. This sensitivity to acetic acid was alleviated by supplementation of the culture medium with KCl/KOH (40/10 mM) both at 30 and 42oC, although the observed effect was not so marked at 42oC. Increased cell viability and cell wall stiffness were observed on addition of KCl/KOH in the presence of acetic acid. It is suggested that improved acetic acid tolerance is due to an increase in potassium uptake allowing an efficient proton efflux, increased membrane integrity and strengthened membrane electrochemical potential. The link between KCl/KOH supplementation and cell wall stiffness needs further study. Temperature stress caused a decrease in the cell wall stiffness which was not relieved by KCl/KOH addition.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2567/1286

Attention is paid to the distribution and properties of the liquid broth within the slabs in relation to the growth parameters ofPichia pastoris.The experimental setup was made of thin slabs supported horizontally by screens within cylindrical chambers. This way, water loss due to compression or gravity drain was minimal and exposure to tangential air flow was maximal. The highest biomass was Xmax= 39.5±3.3 gL-1with (So) of 150 gL-1of glucose. Biomass yield, Yx/sfollowed the correlation, Yx/s= 0.525-0.0018S0(R2= 0.996), and the growth rate m = 0.24 h-1/(S0/34.6). The respiratory quotient, RQ, followed a biphasic pattern with a maximal RQ » 1 when S0= 50 gL-1. PUF micrographs showed that liquid was not retained when the integrity of the polyurethane network was disrupted at cutting edges of the slabs with an approximate depth of 0.025 cm, but the fraction of disrupted PUF would be small for wide slabs and h = 0.7 cm. The use of horizontal PUF slabs with thickness of 0.7 cm seems to be a practical way to upscale solid state fermentation (SSF) since a squared meter of this material could produce 83 g of yeast.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2595/1292

A bioreactor containing a chemically defined medium allowed continuous cultures to develop three dilution rates (0.25, 0.30 y 0.35 h-1), measuring the isoamyl acetate production. Steady-state isoamyl acetate concentration was measured using an entrapping system based on a bubbling column with n-decane. Results demonstrate that the entrapping system showed a linear correlation between the isoamyl acetate concentration into the culture medium and the absorption rate into the column. Airstream for oxygen supply was used to continuously feed isoamyl alcohol to the culture to diminish the inhibitory effect of the precursor. Finally, it was demonstrated that the yeast used the precursor to produce isoamyl acetate (0.144 mg L-1).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2654/1295

The pH of the immobilization was altered to allow different enzyme molecule orientations on the support surface. The concentration of the enzyme exhibited an effect on the stability of the free enzyme. Immobilization by ion exchange maintained up to 80% of the activity of β-glucosidase, however the stabilization was lower than the immobilization by covalent binding on pre-activated supports. The enzyme immobilized on supports pre-activated at pH 5 showed a higher activity of 78% after 24 h. The immobilized enzymes were inactivated at pH 5 and 7, the enzyme immobilized at pH 7 and inactivated at pH 5 maintained greater stability than the immobilized at the other pH values. Considering the enzymatic activity, the stability and the kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and the Km/Ki ratio, the β-glucosidase immobilized on supports pre-activated with glutaraldehyde at pH 5 and 7 are the best option to use β-glucosidase from almonds.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2621/1299

Overexploitation and change in land use have led to a drastic decline in species. In the present work,in vitrocultures were established fromB. karatasseeds and their total phenolic content was determined. To promote the germination of the seeds several scarification treatments were tested. Furthermore, the seeds were cultured on Murashige & Skoog (MS) media containing different concentration of N-6 benzyladenine (BA) with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Obtaining a higher percentage of germination (100%) when exposing the seeds to H2SO4(98%, 5 min) was obtaining. Additionally, inin vitrocultures, the germination time was considerably reduced (36 times), compared to the data reported in the field. Highest percentage of callus induction of leaf sections (1.5 cm2) of adult specimens and plants germinatedin vitroin MS media containing BA (1.0 mg • L-1) + 2,4-D (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg • L-1) was established. Mature fruits ofB. karatasresulted in the greatest phenolic content (1,110 mg GAE • 100 g-1, biomass, dry weight (DW)) measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent method, while the smallest content was recorded for callus and the leaves ofin vitroseedling germinated recorded 205 and 741 mg GAE • 100 g-1DW, respectively. These results provide novel data, which can be part of programs for sustainable use and conservation of this species of ethnobotanical importance.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2685/1305

Maximum production of pullulanase enzyme (5.71 U/ml) was obtained in the medium containing tryptone as carbon and energy source having pH 6.0 when it was inoculated with 3% overnight grown inoculum and incubated at 37°C for 24 hrs.  Optimal conditions for pullalanse enzyme activity were also determined and maximum activity of enzyme (8.584 U/ml) was found with 4% pullulan as a substrate in phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 at 50°C after 20 minutes of incubation. Purification of pullulanase enzyme was achieved to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation as well as by ion exchange chromatography and a distinct band of 97 kDa was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purification fold of purified enzyme was calculated as 16.83 with 37% yield and 45.45 U/mg specific activity. The enzyme was stable up to 90°C and pH 4.0-8.0. In the presence of Ca+2ions, activity of enzyme was increased, whereas EDTA found to reduce the pullulanase enzyme activity.  Addition of 1% Tween 80 and Tween 20 do not showed considerable effects but SDS and DMSO inhibit the pullulanase enzyme activity. No significant effect of organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, acetone, isopropanol, and n-butanol) was detected on enzyme residual activity. Purified pullulanase enzyme showed great stability with laundry detergents and wash performance was increased in the presence of pullulanase along with amylase against starchy stain.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2699/1306

The preharvest control of anthracnose is carried out with synthetic fungicides, so its postharvest use is limited. Chitosan, a non-toxic biopolymer considered GRAS, is an alternative to synthetic fungicide. The aims of the study were to determine in vitro the antifungal effect of chitosan and evaluate the elicitor effect and shelf-life-extending of chitosan on postharvest 'Hass' avocado fruits. A commercial chitosan was used. Nine strains of C. siamense were treated with 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% chitosan. Mycelial grown, sporulation, and germination were evaluated. Avocado fruits were also treated with the same chitosan concentration and stored at room temperature until ripening, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity was evaluated daily. Finally, avocado fruits were inoculated with three strains of C. siamense and subsequently treated with the same chitosan concentrations. Weight loss, color, and firmness were evaluated. As a result, all strains were sensitive to increasing chitosan concentration, reaching 100% inhibition of mycelial growth at 1.5% chitosan. PAL activity was higher in the pulp than in the skin. Weight loss decreased rapidly with 0 and 0.5% chitosan, whereas 1.0 and 1.5% chitosan decreased firmness loss and color change.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2706/1308

In this research, five microorganisms were isolated from mine tailings associated with a high concentration of heavy metals and identified by molecular techniques. Two different samples of mine tailings were the source of culturable strains resistant to HM, native heterotrophic bacterial and fungal microorganisms were isolated and tested for As and Zn resistance (15 mM of  and 20 mM ). Results showed a strain compatible withBacillus cereusas the most resistant bacterial strain (7 mM of  and 5 mM of ), and the fungusExophiala oligospermaas the most tolerant (20 mM for As and 15 mM for Zn). This performance proposes that the strains isolated from the mine tailings are usable tools for the biotreatment of sites contaminated with HM and that they can also have diverse and innovative applications, economically competent, and friendly with the environment.

Moreover, like all food, this product deteriorates over time, as shown by its quality indicators, so it is essential to preserve its original attributes during storage. The work aim was to evaluate the effect of the use of modified atmospheres packaging at two storage conditions (environmental and 18 ºC) on physicochemical (moisture content, water activity, color and reducing sugar content), biological (viability) parameters, fungal infection, and ochratoxin A (OTA) content on GC for one-year storage.

Modeling assumptions include the use of several common calculation bases to express water loss and oil absorption, leading to implicit simplifications such as constant density, constant concentration of fat-free solids or constant concentration of non-defatted solids. The proposed model was used to analyze frying experiments conducted with potato strips (9.5 mm×9.5 mm×80 mm) at different temperatures (160, 175 and 190°C), where product shrinkage was followed via image analysis. The proposed model was solved under two-dimensional mass transfer and water diffusivities were estimated by the method of slopes, with and without considering the dimensional changes of product. Mean water diffusivities were calculated in the range of 0.89×10-8to 4.86×10-8m2/s for the different calculation bases. The way in which water and oil contents are expressed during frying leads to important changes on estimated diffusivities, comparable to those caused by product shrinkage.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2667/1301

Solar drying is a feasible solution for its preservation. However, the optimal drying conditions depend on the dryer material. A natural convection sun-dryer was modified using four different materials: glass, acrylic, polycarbonate, and polyethylene. The moisture content of carambola slices was reduced from 89.23% to final moisture content between 2.2% and 5.9% in a maximum time of 650 min. The final water activity of dried samples ranged from 0.310 to 0.414. The color analysis of carambola indicated a decrease in lightness whileaandbparameters increased; the mix of red and yellow resulted in an orange product which turned slightly brown as lightness decreased. In addition, the ascorbic acid reduced from 338.46 mg/100 g (d.b) to 159.50 mg/100 g- 124.37 mg/100 g (d.b), depending on the cover material.

The hydrolyzed protein flour generated changes during the extrusion process related to its cohesiveness and plasticizer capacity. Regarding its cohesiveness, it was verified with the improvement in the physical properties of the pellet and its plasticizing capacity by reducing the average retention time. The results showed the techno-functional potential of hydrolyzed protein flour for its application in the animal feed industry, being a raw material that can be used as a regulating additive of the physical quality of the pellet.

The composition or quality of various proteins may be so unique that their influence on physiological function in the human body can be quite different. The ability to accurately and objectively define protein quality plays an important role in addressing human nutrition requirements, nutrition policy, trade and product development. Such quality is also influenced by the availability of amino acids, which depends on various factors like source of the protein, previous protein processing treatments, and interactions with other components of food.

It was found that the CFD theoretical results describe the experimentalF(t)-curves obtained with the methodology of “step-signal input”. Later, theF(t)-curves estimated with CFD for each reactor zone were adequately approximated with global parametric models for the development of the TER design equations. The Stagnant Zone Model with mass exchange with the anodic zone turns out to be adequate for the reactor shell zone. However, for the cathode and anode meshes, the Axial Dispersion Model with mass exchange between them proves to be appropriate. For all liquid flow rates (0.37 to 4.0 L min-1), the dispersion numbers (Nd) are in a magnitude order of small dispersion. This confirms that the incorporation of inlet/outlet distributors in a T-ECR improve considerably the liquid flow pattern behaviour. This experimental methodology, coupled with micro/macromixing theoretical analysis of RTD curves with CFD, can be a good alternative for the reactor design.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2434/1288

The effect of the solid / liquid ratio, temperature and reagent concentration in the leaching solutions on the metallic dissolution was analyzed. In both cases, the more stable phase of franklinite (ZnFe2O4) experienced minimal decomposition at room temperature, although almost complete extraction of zinc was possible with sulfuric acid at higher temperatures. The kinetics of franklinite decomposition conformed to the reaction-controlled Shrinking Core Model. Using the Arrhenius expression, the apparent activation energies for franklinite and lead dissolutions in H2SO4were evaluated. On the other hand, citrate showed promise due to its selectivity in leaching non-ferrous metals oxides (ZnO and PbO).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2606/1290

In the present work, the kinetics of esterification of glycol ethers with acetic acid to obtain glycol ether acetates was studied. Different synthesis conditions were evaluated, such as reaction temperature, catalyst type, catalyst loading and molar ratio between reactants. Uncatalyzed, catalyzed under homogeneous conditions with pTSA and under heterogeneous conditions with Amberlyst 15 were carried out. Second order kinetic model for the homogeneous system and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model for the heterogeneous system were proposed and the fit to the experimental data was performed to estimate the reaction rate constants. It was found that the maximum in reaction conversion depends mostly on the ratio between reactants, while temperature, catalyst type and catalyst loading have a significant effect on the reaction rate. Models’ predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and the values of the reaction rate constants are consistent with values reported in other studies.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2549/1291

A simplified plasma reactor model is presented, and the experimental setup and methodology used to verify the model are presented as well. Experimental conversion data is used to establish a pseudo-first order kinetic constant for the reactor, assuming a plug flow continuous reactor model and using the residence time as the independent variable for the study. Residence time on the experiments was varied by either increasing the length of the reactor (series array) or by splitting the gas flow (parallel array). A rate coefficient of 0.002 s-1was found for the conditions of the experiment. The selectivity and kinetic pathways are beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in future work; nevertheless, a qualitative assessment of the hydrocarbon degradation products is presented for the experiments carried out.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2602/1297

In this work, the biological sulfide oxidation process was assessed under two novel dynamic pulse respirometric approaches:in-situpulse respirometry conducted in airlift bioreactor andex-situpulse respirometry carried out in microreactors (microrespirometry) with samples taken from the airlift bioreactor. The process was characterized in terms of the growth yield, substrate oxidation yield, maximum oxygen uptake rate, affinity constant, and mass transfer coefficient. Thein-situpulse respirometry showed to be a reproducible technique that allowed the determination of the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters besides the detection of mass transfer limitations in the airlift bioreactor, however, its use in biological sulfide oxidation is limited to a few experiments and experimental conditions with significant time investment. On the other hand, theex-situpulse microrespirometry allowed the acquisition of a higher amount of information under a broader range of sulfide concentrations (from 5 to 60 mg H2S L-1) and experimental conditions such as different pH values. The results obtained showed that theex-situmicrorespirometry technique would be preferable overin-situpulse respirometry for the proper and reliable characterization of the sulfide oxidation process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2575/1289

This study proposes an accessible analytical tool to predict the capacity of a soil to sequester hydrocarbons considering the chemical characteristics of humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) in SOM. The natural soil was modified by thermal treatments, obtaining five different soils. Their SOM was fractionated into HA and FA, and each fraction was characterized by UV-Vis and FTIR. The soils were contaminated with a hydrocarbon mixture (hexadecane [HXD], phenanthrene [PHE], and pyrene [PYR]), and the sequestered concentration of each hydrocarbon was quantified. The soil treated at 350 ºC presented seven times greater capacity to sequester polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs >100 mg∙[kg soil]-1) than that of the natural soil. The characteristics that significantly improved the sequestration of PAHs were: i) FA with low molecular weight and degree of condensation, and ii) HA with high molecular weight, aromaticity, aliphaticity, polarity and degree of condensation. Based on these results, two equations are proposed to predict, with more than 80% accuracy, the sequestration of PAHs in soils with different composition through UV-Vis and FTIR analysis of HA.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2660/1296

Commercial turbidimeters are priced at the range of hundreds tothousands of dollars. Considering this scenario, it is proposed in this work the developmentof a low-cost portable turbidimeter for monitoring of turbidity in processes. An infrared LEDwas used as light emitter, and an infrared phototransistor as light receiver. The signalprocessing control unit was developed with the Arduino Uno platform. The calibration of theturbidimeter was done by means of a comparative test in triplicate, using as reference thecommercial turbidimeter 2100P, HACH®. The turbidimeter was able to perform analysis inthe range of 100 to 1000 NTU, presenting an innovation character given its portability andcomputer communication via USB, and in a good price range for the prototype, costing US$46.30",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2559/1293

On the other hand, low-cost lignocellulosic biomass can be converted to bioethanol. Both processes can be integrated through energy flows, expecting reductions on the total energy requirements and environmental impact. Therefore, in this work the integration through energy flows between biodiesel and bioethanol processes is performed, along with its impact in terms of total annual cost and environmental impact. The processes are first integrated as separated entities, then the effect of integrating both processes in a biorefinery scheme is analyzed. According to the results, the heat integration of both processes allows reducing around 15% of the total annual cost associated to heat exchangers. Moreover, the integration even allows reductions in the capital costs for the supercritical process.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2534/1294

However, control systems using this strategy directly alter hydrodynamic conditions thus interrelating oxygen and momentum transfer effects in the culture. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an alternative DOT control system using an algorithm that allows further study of oxygen and momentum transfer effects separately. A novel algorithm was designed with three mass flow controllers by manipulating oxygen partial pressure  The developed system tightly controlled DOT at 30% in a 3-L bioreactor withEscherichia coli, maintaining constant gas flow and agitation.  The energy dissipation rate (EDR) by agitation was maintained at 0.06 W/kg, and EDR variations via bubble wake and bursting were diminished. The accumulated DOT control error was 42% lower than that of a standard commercial controller. Additionally, the system effectively responded to perturbations on set point (30, 50, and 80%) and agitation (200, 500, and 1000 rpm). To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first characterization of a DOT controller in terms of EDR and control error that could be used to study oxygen and momentum transfer effects separately in STB.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2607/1298

In this paper is presented, an algorithm to determine the kinetic parameters for the coal flotation process in a fast and practical way, using a spreadsheet. A 22factorial design was run with three replicates. The selected factors were: concentration of methyl isobutyl carbinol as foaming agent, and diesel as a collector. For both foaming agent and collector, low and high levels were 25 g/ton, and 100 g/ton respectively. To verify the model’s curvature, an intermediate point was included. The statistical analysis of the fuel recovery and kinetic flotation is presented. Three kinetic models were used for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, García-Zuñiga’s algorithm, and both of the algorithms proposed by Klimpel. With the analysis of variance, it is concluded that both factors influence significantly the efficiency of coal flotation. However, the factor that has the most significant effect is the foaming agent. It is also concluded that the proposed algorithm is functional, presenting correlation coefficients higher than 0.9948.

Results have shown that the extract was a good corrosion inhibitor with an efficiency that increased with its concentration. Corrosion and passivation current density values were decreased indicating that the extract behaves as an anodic type of corrosion inhibitor. Inhibitor was adsorbed on to the metal surface in a combination of physical and chemical, dominated by a physical type of adsorption following a Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
