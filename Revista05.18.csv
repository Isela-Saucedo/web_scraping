In particular, we address the effect of the pore diameter of the support (varied between about 3 nm for MCM-41 and 10 nm for SBA-15), the dimensionality of the channels (1-D in MCM-41 and 3-D in MCM-48), the cobalt loading (from 10 to 40 wt%), and the addition of noble metals (Pt, Re) as promoters. In addition, we show the benefit of introducing small amounts of cerium in the structure of MCM-41 during the synthesis of the support on the stability of the catalyst against deactivation. The materials have been characterized by different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic results for the FTS can be well correlated with two main parameters, the dispersion and reducibility of the supported cobalt phases, which are closely related and which determine, to a great extent, the amount of active sites (Co0) available on the catalyst surface.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1906/991

TiO2 and ZrO2 surface species were found to be well dispersed on SBA-15 surface (DRS, XRD). In the NiMo catalysts supported on SBA-15 materials, the dispersion of Ni and Mo oxide species increased with TiO2 or ZrO2 loading in the support. A larger dispersion effect is observed with the ZrO2 loading. Catalytic activity tests in 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) hydrodesulfurization (HDS) showed that the modification of SBA-15 supports with Ti and Zr species significantly improves the performance of NiMo catalysts in HDS of refractory dibenzothiophenes. The activity observed for the NiMo catalysts is closely related with the metallic species (Mo and Ni) dispersion on the support surface.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1908/992

We built a continuos, fixed-bed reaction system. We employed Ga-MCM-41,Al-MCM-41, commercial FCC Y zeolite (fresh and equilibrium) and natural mordenite as catalysts. We set the following reaction conditions: 450 °C reaction temperature, constant feed flow and 30 min reaction time at atmospheric pressure. We analyzed the gas and liquid products by gas chromatography and simulated distillation (ASTM D-2887), respectively.

From the whole results obtained by means of GCMS, a 57% selectivity was to 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane and 36% was to by-products of ethylene glycol photooxidation.

Specific surface area of the samples was determined by the BET method with N2 adsorption. Crystalline phases of the samples were determined by XRD and the morphology was observed by SEM. The reduction of the active phase was determined by TPR. The catalytic activity of the samples was studied by the NO reduction with CO. The addition of CeO2 to titania shows a positive effect on the specific area of the catalysts until 50% of CeO2 was reached. Samples showed diffractions peaks and a broad background pattern as a function of the CeO2/TiO2 ratio. The reduction of CuO/TiO2-CeO2 catalysts evidenced the existence of different kinds of CuO species and shift of the high-temperature peak to lower temperature, as a function of the enrichment of CeO2 phase to TiO2 phase. The reactivity of the CuO/CeO2 catalyst in the NO + CO reaction was higher than the all series of studied catalysts. This behavior is attributed to the presence of the highly dispersed Cu on the catalyst as it was shown byTPR.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1960/1017

The reaction was carried out in a Parr reactor at 120 ºC and 10 bars of O2pressure. RhSn/γ-Al2O3catalyst was more active than Rh/γ-Al2O3catalyst. The increment in the content of Ce, favors the selectivity toward CO2, this is explained by the formation Ce4+-O2-M+ species, which improve the capacity of oxidation of the catalyst. The catalyst RhSn/γ-Al2O3-Ce5showed the best selectivity toward CO2.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1969/1026

The results show that 3.0 wt% B addition to Al2O3does not diminish the textural properties. In addition, boron enhances both density and strength of the acid sites. By means of UV-vis DRS it was found that for the boron-modified catalyst, the amount of metals in strong interaction with the support, Ni and Mo tetrahedrally coordinated, is lower than for the boron-free catalyst, suggesting an increase in the number of hydrodesulfurization sites. It was shown that boron-modified support and catalyst perform the 4,6-DMDBT isomerization. Besides in the catalyst the hydrogenation function was improved. Therefore it was obtained a catalyst able to remove sulfur from highly refractory compounds like 4,6-DMDBT by the benefit from alternative reaction routes (hydrogenation and isomerization).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1972/1028

It was found that alumina supports prepared by ammonium carbonate and urea hydrolysis methods have improved pore size distribution (PSD) as well as pore volume. The HDM activity increases while the HDS activity decreases with increasing the average pore diameter (APD). The results of HDM and HDAs activities of catalyst protrude distinct contribution of PSD of support which has more capabilities to retain metal deposition and better diffusion of complex organo-metallic compounds. It has been also proposed that deposited vanadium and nickel sulfides may act as auto-catalytic activity for HDM and HDAs.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1973/1029

The phases of CoMoP/SiO2 and CoWP/SiO2 were obtained according to X-ray diffraction patterns reported in the literature. Mesoporous materials with high specific area were obtained. Cobalt-molybdenum materials exhibited greater pore diameter, which promotes higher hydrodesulfurization activity of bigger molecules. All the catalysts showed acidity, with weak acid sites distribution, with an increase of total number of acid sites due to the increasing phosphorus concentration of catalysts. The cobalt-molybdenum materials were the most active in heavy vacuum gas oil hydrodesulfurization, with sulfur removal slightly lower than that of a commercial catalyst. The optimal Co/(Co+Mo) ratio of 0.3 was also corroborated.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1990/1030

The catalytic activity of hydrotalcite-like compounds and their mixed oxides, obtained after calcination, were studied in the aldolic condensation of acetone in liquid phase. The reaction products were identified by gas chromatography. Only the Mg/Al = 4 hydrotalcite showed some activity (0.030 % after 4 hours), instead the corresponding calcined sample reached a conversion four times higher (0.10 % after four hours) and the main product was diacetone alcohol. The sample treated at 600 W and calcined deactivated as the catalyst was not stable.

We used the surfactant assisted route to prepare dispersed nanocrystalline ceria into high surface SiO2(CeO2-SiO2) or pure CeO2(S-CeO2). The catalysts were characterized by N2adsorption, DRX, HREM, TPR and DRIFT. The catalytic activity was studied using the CO oxidation with O2as probe. We observed an influence of the CeO2crystal size on the redox properties; reduction of Ce4+ is easier as the crystal size decreases. The addition of cooper to ceria promotes even more its reduction. The best catalyst was the CuO/S-CeO2sample. The CO adsorption followed by DRIFT evidenced different reduced Cu species as a function of the support. A synergetic effect due to the formation of CuO-CeO2interfaces explains the observed catalytic behavior.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1992/1032

Due to the importance","Hydrotalcites are microporous materials with a lamellar structure and anionic exchange properties. They can be used in many applications depending on cristallinity, composition, thermal stability and other physicochemical properties. Due to the importance of these materials, many studies developing new synthesis techniques have been proposed, among them, the synthesis by microwave irradiation has many advantages, mainly due to the reduction of reaction time. In this work the synthesis of basic hydrotalcite-like compounds with a Mg/Al composition and with molar ratios Mg/Al of 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1, is presented. The synthesis gels were treated hydrothermically in a microwave reactor operating at 200 W, at a temperature of 80°C and at atmosphere pressure. In addition, some samples were synthesized with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 3 with different irradiation power (400 and 600 W) to determine the power effect on the structural and morphological features. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption (BET area). It was found that purity, specific surface area and crystallinity depend on the Mg/Al molar ratio. Furthermore, thermal stability increases with irradiation power as the specific surface area.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1993/1033

This study was performed using a model diesel prepared with dibenzothiophene, 4-methyl dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene in hexadecane, H2O2 as oxidant agent, V2O5/Al2O3 as catalyst and acetonitrile or butyrolactone as extraction solvents. It was observed that temperature has important effects on the process, which are independent from the solvent used. At high temperatures, the process can be well represented by a consecutive scheme, with the oxidation reaction taking place mostly in the solvent phase. At low temperatures, a parallel-consecutive scheme is observed. These differences with temperature can be ascribed to the amount of H2O2 in the system, which changes due to its thermal decomposition.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,

Modified carbons were loaded with Ni and Mo to have an atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni+Mo) = 0.3 by means of the incipient wetness method. Specific surface area and total pore volume of the materials were determined using the low temperature N2 adsorption technique, and their total acidity by n-butylamine potentiometric titration and the 2-propanol dehydration reaction test. Catalytic activity of the NiMo/CA materials was measured in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene and atmospheric gas oil. Both charcoals showed good thermal stability. A correlation between the total acidity measured by n-butylamine potentiometric titration and by 2-propanol dehydration, and the HNO3 solution concentration was observed.

To synthesize this kind of catalysts we used two different methods: (a) reaction of ammonium thiomolybdotungstate ((NH4)4MoWS8) with an aqueous solution of NiCl2·6H2O and (b) impregnation of ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O on ammonium thiotungstate (ATT). Subsequently, the catalysts were obtained by thermal decomposition of precursors (ex-situ activation) under a reductive atmosphere of H2S/H2 (15% H2S) at 400°C. The precursor prepared by reaction was first treated hydrothermically in a stainless steel autoclave at 250 °C for 2 h.

Catalysts were obtained by thermal spreading, V2O5/Al2O3and V2O5/TiO2. According to the DBT activity in jet fuel, the catalyst and oxidant agent (H2O2or tertbutyl hydroperoxide) was chosen. Results show that total removal of S-compounds and DBT sulfone yield is improved using H2O2and V2O5/Al2O3catalyst. Using this catalyst and oxidant, ODS reactivity of dibenzothiophenic compounds (BT, DBT, 4-MDBT and 4,6-DMDBT) in both diesel and jet fuel was evaluated.

Activity tests were performed with a model diesel consisting in dibenzothiophene, 4-methyl dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene. The reaction was carried out at 60°C, with supported vanadium catalysts and H2O2 as oxidant agent. Results show that long-term extraction considerably enhances organosulfur oxidation and slightly increases total sulfur removal. It was also observed that oxidation performed in presence of both phases (diesel and solvent) is essential to obtain high sulfone production. At these conditions, it was proven that water in the reaction system inhibits the organosulfur compounds extraction from the diesel phase and, in consequence, the sulfone production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2007/1040

TiO2-Al2O3mixed oxides with 5, 10 and 90 % mol of Al2O3were synthesized by the sol-gel method. Characterization of the support was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ζ-potential and N2physisorption. Ni and Mo superficial species were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis-DRS) and Raman spectroscopies, respectively. DRX results show that TiO2-Al2O3mixed oxides present a gamma-alumina and amorphous-titania structures. The ζ-potential results show that the supports have surfaces with similar charges and net surface pH between 7-8. Raman spectroscopy shows that the net surface pH of support controls the symmetry of Mo oxide, which is octahedral, whereas MoO42-, Mo7O246-and Mo8O364-clusters distribution is controlled by Al2O3concentration. The catalysts with high Al2O3 content show vibration modes due to Mo-O-Mo stretching, whereas the low Al2O3content catalysts these modes are of the terminal Mo=Ot bond. UV-vis-DRS results show the coexistence of Ni2+ ion with tetrahedral [Ni2+4O2-] and octahedral [Ni2+6O2-] coordination. Catalysts with high contents of Al2O3favor the tetrahedral Ni2+ ion that forms the Ni2+/γ-Al2O3spinel. Catalysts with low contents of Al2O3favor the octahedral Ni2+ ion, indicating a mayor interaction with octahedral Mo oxide species.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2008/1041

The supports were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, infrared spectroscopy, potentiometric titration with n-butylamine and 2-propanol dehydration. After calcination, the supports were impregnated with 0.5 wt % of platinum and tested in the isomerization of n-pentane at atmospheric pressure. The acidity of ZrO2 was favored by incorporation of the borate ion in the structure. This dopping agent, besides modifying the materials acidity, delayed the sintering of the material allowing surface areas up to 117 m2/g, four times above the surface area achieved with pure ZrO2 calcined at 600ºC.

The techniques used to determine the acidity were NH3-TPD and 2-propanol dehydration. Through NH3-TPD was determined the acid distribution in relation to temperature variation. Results from this technique indicated the presence of acid sites from weak to very strong concentrating in the range of moderate to very strong acidity. The order of acidity shown by this technique was H2SO4>HCl >HNO3 indicating the same the tendency with the conversion-selectivity results in the dehydration of isopropanol where propylene and diisopropyl ether were obtained as products.
