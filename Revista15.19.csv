Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Editorial,"Con este número iniciamos nuestra labor editorial como Editores en Jefe. La labor reali­zada por quienes nos antecedieron permitió que la Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas (RMCG) se encuentre colocada como una de las revistas científicas sobre Ciencias de la Tierra con mayor prestigio en nuestro país, esto es aliciente para iniciar nuestra labor editorial con entusiasmo y nos permite aprovechar las experiencias ganadas en los años anteriores. Iniciamos nuestra gestión editorial con el ánimo de mantener el prestigio de la RMCG y lograr un soste­nido aumento en nuestros indicadores bibliométricos. Para ello tenemos contemplado realizar en el corto plazo algunos cambios que permitan agilizar el proceso editorial. Quizá el más relevante sea el uso delOpen Journal System(OJS) para gestionar el proceso editorial de los manuscritos, lo cual también nos permitirá migrar a formatos de publicación más amigables para la web. Iniciaremos el uso de este sistema a partir del mes de abril del 2016.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/555/432
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Nomenclarure proposal and provenance analysis of the Concepción del Oro Formation (former Formación Caracol): implications for the tectonic evolution of southern North America in the Late Cretaceous,"The Upper Cretaceous clastic successions cropping out around Concepción del Oro, traditionally recognized as Caracol Formation, are redefined in this work and formally named as Concepción del Oro Formation. This unit is key to understanding the geological evolution of the Mesozoic Basin of Central Mexico. Its type locality is in Tierras Blancas II canyon, northwest of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas. The Concepción del Oro Formation is composed of the Tierras Blancas and Rancho Viejo members. The Tierras Blancas Member consists of an nor­mal graded succession composed of rhythmically interbedded shale and sandstone; Innoceramus labiatus impressions indicate a late Turonian to early Coniacian age. The Rancho Viejo Member is characterized by both, a normal and inverse graded succession of shale and sandstone; ammonite impressions (Texanites genus) indicate a late Coniacian to early Campanian age. A total thickness of 1200 m was estimated includ­ing both members of Concepción del Oro Formation. The stratigraphic and sedimentological characteristics described in this study are different from the original characteristics of the Caracol Formation; therefore, the name, Concepción del Oro Formation, is proposed for locally use in the vicinity of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/556/433

It has a southwest-northeast trend and is one of the depocenters of the cretaceous-paleogene basin (northwestern Argentina). This trough is a typical continental rift basin in the sense of ""triple junction point"". The isostatic state of Lomas the Olmedo trough was evaluated through the Airy-Heiskanen’s isostatic compensation model and the statistical analysis of the gravity anomalies.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/642/496

Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Secular variation and excursions of the Earth magnetic field during the Plio-Quaternary: New paleomagnetic data from radiometrically dated lava flows of the Colima volcanic complex (western Mexico),"Detailed rockmagnetic and paleomagnetic investigations were performed on selected lava flows from the Colima volcanic complex (CVC) located in the western sector of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Reliable paleomagnetic directions were obtained from 21 Ar-Ar dated lava flows (205 standard paleomagnetic cores) within the age interval from 372 to 34 kyr. Ti-poor titanomagnetite is the main magnetic carrier in most of the samples, while some of them exhibit Curie temperatures ranging from 300°C to 340°C. Nineteen sites yielded normal polarity magnetization as expected from Brunhes Chron lavas, while two remaining lava flows show clearly defined transitional paleomagnetic directions. The mean direction, excluding the transitional data, is Dm=1.2°, Im=38.2° (k=39.5,α95=5.5°). The corresponding paleomagnetic pole is located at a longitude φ=270.1° and a latitude λ=87.6° (K=35.9,A95=5.3°). This paleodirection is practically indistinguishable from the one expected for Pleistocene, as derived from the references poles for the stable North America. This suggests that no major tectonic rotation occurred in the studied area. The paleosecular variation is analysed through the scatter of virtual geomagnetic poles (VGP). The dispersion estimated through the parameter SF=13.0°, with an upper confidence limit SU=15.2° and a lower confidence limit SL=12.7° is consistent with  the recent geomagnetic field models for the last 5 Myr. The present study yields the evidence of  two ""transitional"" lava flows, whose age likely correspond to the Mono Lake or Laschamp excursion and to the Calabrian Ridge I or Portuguese Margin excursion, respectively.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/641/495
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Mineral chemistry and geochemistry of mantle xenoliths from the Santo Domingo volcanic field, San Luis Potosí: Evidences of mantle metasomatic processes beneath portions of the Mesa Central, Mexico","The Santo Domingo volcanic field consists of at least four Quaternary maars: Santo Domingo, Joya de los Contreras, El Banco and Joya Prieta, as well as a cinder cone and associated lava flows (La Pólvora). Mantle peridotites - mainly spinel lherzolite – occur as xenoliths that were carried to the surface by mafic alkalic intraplate magmas. Outstanding features of the xenoliths of Santo Domingo, compared with other xenolith localities in central and northern Mexico, are the porphyroclastic texture, abundance of kaersutite megacrysts. Composite xenoliths, wherein hornblendite veinlets cut across the foliation in the peridotite, show that the hydrated phases come from the mantle. Composite xenoliths, where hornblende veinlets cut across the mylonitic foliation in the peridotite, show that the hydrated phases come from the mantle.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/643/497
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Stratigraphy of summit areas of the Sierras Pampeanas of Córdoba: geochronology, regional model, paleoenvironment and paleoclimate ina little-known region of Argentina","The Eastern Sierras Pampeanas system spreads over a vast center- west area of Argentina forming the central Andean foreland; it presents plain surfaces, paleosurfaces of erosive origin their mountain sum- mits, called “Pampas de Altura”. The Cenozoic stratigraphic studies  in these areas are punctual, perhaps, product of the lack of continu- ity of stratigraphy and the difficult access to areas of study, being relegated to traditional research inside the Pampas of Argentina. This work aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of stratigraphic registry of this “Pampas de Altura”, with an integrated vision, in order to analyze their paleoclimatic, paleoenvironmental and geochronological significance and provide a framework for future studies in the region. The stratigraphic and sedimentary analysis identified five facies within Cordoba's Pampas de Altura. This is to say: 1) sandy-silt with calcium carbonate megatabiques, 2) red silty-sand with clasts, 3) laminated and cemented silty-sands, 4) yellowish massive sandy-silt with clasts   and 5) dark massive sandy silt. These facies were grouped into associated fluvial/Aeolian facies. These facies were included in a lithostratigraphic unit named Vaca Corral Formation, and has an age between 37,095 ± 2,020 (OSL) and 7,206 cal. (AMS) yr. BP. The evidence allowed hypothesizing a paleoenvironment similar to the current savannah and/ or grassland for the Pampa de Altura's, discussed in this work, during the Late Pleistocene period and most of the Holocene period as well. Vegetal communities would have been dominated by grasslands, small- size bushes and gallery forests. Great rivers tracks were not registered and probably seasonal floods were frequent at that time. From the mid- dle Holocene period climate change to more wet and cold condi- tions is registered, with a replacement in the dominance of grasses   by  trees and  shrubs. These conditions would have remained up to 1,500 year BP. The evidence discussed here, lithological, pedoge- netic and temporary, permits us to hypothesize a possible resilience of the mountain system; which became less susceptible to drastic climate changes.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/644/498
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,A low cost technique for development of ultra-high resolution topography: application to a dry maar’s bottom,"We developed an ultra-high resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) of a 1.2 km ×1.2 km dry maar bottom located in Parangueo, Mexico. This maar is unique by the fact that it displays a large number and variety of structures associated with active deformation and high albedo sediments. We used a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (quad- copter) and a consumer grade camera to develop both a DSM and an orthophoto at a resolution of 4.7 cm through the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms from PhotoScan Pro, a commercially available software. Using the coordinates of 31 Ground Control Points measured with an RTK GPS, the residuals of the DSM had an RMSE=3.3 cm and a mean of 2.6 cm on the horizontal, with an RMSE=1.8 cm and a mean=-0.3 cm on the vertical. With this methodology we were able to construct a three dimensional model of unprecedented detail showing all structures (fractures, domes and escarpments) that have been cre- ated due to the active deformation of the dry bed lake. We conclude that the use of both UAVs and SfM provides accurate high resolution DSMs that can be obtained at a low cost, even in areas with highly reflective surfaces. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied on different dates to create a time series of high resolution DSMs, which can be used to determine subsidence or uplift rates in areas with ac- tive deformation.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/645/499
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Age and origin of the gabbros in the Jilotlán pluton, Jalisco: primitive magmatic rocks in the southern part of the Guerrero terrane","An outstanding feature of the Mexican Cordilleran magmatic arc between Sonora and Chiapas is the presence of numerous plutonic and batholitic bodies of Cretaceous to Miocene ages. In this contribution, we investigated the petrogenesis and age of the gabbros from Jilotlán, Jalisco, in order to better understand their genetic relation with the intruding and surrounding Late Cretaceous calc-alkaline mantle-type granitoids. Gabbros from Manzanillo (Colima), Tepalcaltepec, and Aquila (Michoacán) were also studied. The objective of this work is to contribute new findings to the tectonic setting and magma generation processes of the Cretaceous magmatic arc in the coastal Zihuatanejo terrane, which is part of the Guerrero terrane.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/646/500
