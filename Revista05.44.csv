The model includes the effects of substrate and product inhibition, substrate limitation and some pseudo parameters that arefunction of the operation conditions: temperature, pH and glucose-xylose concentration. From experimental data reported in the literature it was performed a multivariate analysis, fitting the pseudo parameters. The simulation results with theproposed model are compared against experimental data and against a constant parameter model reported in the literature. The average error obtained with the proposed model is less than the error generated by the model reported in the literature and reproduces the process variables at different operating conditions with an average error of 8.2%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1012/370

Aspergillus niger, a known producer of feruloyl and other carbohydrate esterases, was used as fungal model. Cultures with corn bran induced a highproduction of feruloyl esterase type A and B activity: 5.27 and 0.66 U gˉⁱ of dry matter over methyl ferulate and caffeate hydrolysis, respectively. Furthermore, in cultures with coffee pulp it is selectively induced the production of feruloylesterase B activity compared to other by-products used. A zymographic analysis of extracts of cultures on corn and wheat bran revealed another enzyme, later identified as acetylxylan esterase A, capable to hydrolyze methyl hydroxycinnamatesand p-nitrophenyl acetate. Activity on p-nitrophenyl acetate was 33.4 U gˉⁱ of dry matter on cultures grown on corn bran. This work is the first report of high production of feruloyl and acetylxylan esterases using corn bran as substrate, which areenzymes of increasing biotechnological interest.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1013/371

The species Pleurotus sp. CBT1, Pleurotus sp. CBT2 and Pycnoporus sanguineous were adapted to a culture medium containing lignin as a carbon source. The degradation of lignin in the culture medium was present between 12 and 72 h of fermentation for the three species, yielding degradation of 72, 60 and 54% for Pleurotus sp. CBT1, Pleurotussp. CBT2 and Pycnoporus sanguineous respectively, which coincided with the maximum levels of enzyme activity on MnP of 4.59, 2.24 and 4.19 IU/L for Pleurotus sp. CBT1, Pleurotus sp. CBT2 and P. sanguineous, respectively. Later, fique spall was subjected to degradation in fermented broth Pleurotus sp. CBT1, Pleurotus sp. CBT2 and P. sanguineous at pH 5.0, temperature of 50 °C and 30 min of enzymatic action. The fermented broth from Pleurotus sp. CBT1 after 48 h of fermentation showed lignin degradation in the fique spall of 65.2 % higher than other species, decreasing the initial lignin content of 14.1 % to 4.9 % and an increase in cellulose content of 61.8 to 73.1%.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1016/373

In its inorganic form, selenium can be potentially toxic for human health, while its availability increases in its organic form and its toxicity declines. Inorganic selenium is incorporated in some lactic acid bacteria, which are commonly used as starter in fermented dairy products. The aim of this research was to determine and quantify the capacity of selenium incorporation in Lactobacillus ssp. metabolism, by ICP. Culture media were enriched with Na₂SeO₃ in order to determine such capacity. Four lactic acid bacteria were used and their tolerance to selenium was determined by dding Na₂SeO₃ to growth medium. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG presented the highest tolerance (198 mg/L). Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB2772 showed the lowest assimilation of inorganic selenium (9.14%) while L. helveticus IUAMI70129 had the highest (76.50%) despite being the microorganism which displayed the least tolerance (43 mg/L). On the other hand, Lactobacillus jhonsonii showed the highest concentration of selenium in terms of generated biomass weight (0.91 µg/mg). Finally, all bacteria under study assimilated inorganic selenium. Therefore, they could be used as starter cultures or as functional ingredients, for elaboration of foods enriched with selenium.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1017/1221

When administrated in hormonal replacement therapy, DHEA improves BMD. Although there are various physical and drug treatments to prevent bone loss, the results have generally been poor. For this reason, cellular therapy based on the application of mesenchymal stem cells has emerged as an attractive alternative. In this study the effect of DHEA on osteogenic gene expression of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Cell population obtained was characterized as having fibroblastoid morphology and the expression of antigens positive for CD90, CD73, CD13 and CD105. The plasticity of hBM-MSCs was evident and corroborated by adipocytes and osteoblast differentiation. DHEA concentration used in all experiments were 1, 10 and 100 µM during seven days and after the expression of mRNA BMP2, RUNX2 and SPARC (the main involved genes on osteogenic differentiation) was evaluated. Results showed that all DHEA concentration induced high expression on mRNA of BMP2, RUNX2 and SPARC. However, DHEA at 1µM induced a higher accumulation of extracellular Ca++ which its a characteristic for bone formation. This work confirms that DHEA could be considered an alternative in the treatment of bone diseases.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1018/375

This enzyme has been identified in different fungus isolated from Mexican semi-desert plants. Some of these fungal strains such as Aspergillus niger GH1 and PSH strain have demonstrated to be excellent enzyme producers. In the present study, tannase was produced under submerged state culture, with its maximum activity at 24 h. At the same time, a fragment of tannase gene from GH1and PSH strains was isolated and expression of tannase was determinate by RT-PCR (at 16 h,). It was found that tannase sequences of GH1 and PSH strain are 97% similar to the A. niger strain SL-5 reported in GeneBank. The translation ofGH1 and PSH amino acid sequences demonstrated its identity with tannase.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1026/378

Yarrowia lipolytica is non-pathogenic yeast reported as excellent strain for protease production. The aim of this work was todetermine the effect of pH, temperature and source of protein and carbohydrates on protease production by Y. lipolytica in solid culture. Fish flour (FF) and soybean meal (SM) were tested as protein and carbohydrates source at three levels of pH (5, 7 y 9) and temperature (40, 45 and 50 °C) for protease production by Y. lipolytica. Optimal conditions and substrate source for maximal enzymatic production were defined by statistical analysis. The pH value exhibited the greatest effect on protease production, maximal protease activity (105 UI/mL) was reached when using SM as protein and carbon source at pH 7, 45 °C after 24 h-culture. Process time was reduced around 83 % from similar research reports. Soybean meal is an excellent low cost substrate for proteases production by Y. lipolytica.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1027/381

Furthermore, its products, made of nixtamalized corn flours like tortilla chips are consumed worldwide. Thus, the presence of acrylamide, a potential carcinogen formed during frying oftortilla products, is a great concern due to its possible health effects. Given that pigmented maize contains many secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds which might have an influence on the acrylamide content, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acrylamide formation in tortilla chips prepared from white (commercial) and different pigmented (black, red, purple and yellow) nixtamalized flours. Acrylamide content of tortilla chips was correlated with the physicochemical properties of the flours. The results showed that acrylamide content in tortilla samples fried 30 s was mainly affected by the fat (r=0.82), anthocyanin (r=-0.51) and total phenolic concentration (r=0.42) in flour (p<0.05). Furthermore, lower levels of acrylamide were found in tortilla chips prepared from red and black maize in comparison with purple, yellow and the commercial one. These results suggest that the selection of maize genotypes rich in anthocyanins as well as lower levels of fat and phenolic compounds could reduce acrylamide formation in tortilla chips and other tortilla-based foods thermally processed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1029/382

However, its bioavailability is low as it is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Nanoemulsions offer the potential toimprove the solubility and bioavailability of bioactive compounds; and compared with the traditional mechanical methods, ultrasound is a superior tool to obtain nanoemulsions with smaller and homogeneous globule size and physical stability. The goal of this study was to develop a curcumin nanoemulsion by ultrasonication, containing a high curcumin load, small droplet size and good physical stability. The composition and preparation method effects on entrapment efficiency,droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of the nanoemulsions were evaluated. Curcumin nanoemulsions were successfully prepared by combined thin-film hydration emulsification and ultrasonication methods, employing 50 % ofglycerol in the aqueous phase, and 10 % of soybean lecithin as emulsifier; at 20 % amplitude for 12 min in the sonicator. Nanoemulsions with 2.5 mg curcumin per g, 100 % entrapment efficiency, mean droplet size of 108 nm, and stable for 120days at 4°C were obtained.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1030/384

The effects of concentration of nanoparticles and types of nanoparticles on the absorption rate were investigated. The packed column was used to study gas liquid countercurrent flow. The results indicated that the optimum value was equal to 0.05 vol% for both nanofluids, and also addition of nanoparticles increased the mass transfer rate. Besides, the maximum enhancement of mass transfer rate for nanoparticles of Al2O3 and mixture of Al2O3 - SiO2 compared to the pure water was 14% and 10% at 0.05 vol% of the nanofluid, respectively",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1106/413

The extended method takes in to account several aspects as classic McCabe-Thiele method under transformed reaction-invariant composition variables as: minimum number of reactive theoretical stages, number of reactive theoretical stages, minimum reflux ratio, feed tray location, top and = or bottom flow. Reaction equilibrium is assumed on each stage, vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed on all stages and is also considered a reactive Murphree vapor tray efficiency. The methodology is illustrated in two ideal reactive systems. The results of the reactive McCabe-Thiele method agree with those obtained using a rigorous method in commercial simulator AspenONE Aspen Plus (Radfrac module).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1107/414

The species distribution diagrams are useful for predicting the physicochemical conditions for achieving major control for materials deposition. By using ZnCl2or ZnSO4, KOH, NH4NO3and SC(NH2)2as chemical reagents for the bath, as well as the most probably chemical reactions between these chemical reagents, a range of deposition temperature (from 25 to 90 °C) and the different species formed by these reagents concentrations, the species distribution diagrams as a function of the pH were obtained. By using the species diagrams, thin films were deposited under different conditions in order to highlight their importance to obtain ZnS, ZnO and Zn(OH)2thin films with better optical and structural qualities. The results indicate that the better conditions for obtaining the high quality films can change with the bath temperature and with the concentrations of the chemical reagents.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1110/415

The resulting mechanical properties were analyzed using the response surface methodology. The results show that the compatibilizing agent Joncryl improved the tensile strength of the PLA/starch blend. The addition of Joncryl and sorbitol, enhanced the elongation at break to the PLA/starch blend. These agents also contributed to improve the morphology of the mixture, since there was a change in fracture mode from brittle to ductile. The citrate plasticizer not only did not help in improving the ductility of the blends, but inhibits both the sorbitol plasticization and Joncryl compatibilization effciency",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/1116/420

The control scheme concerns the output regulation of the organic matter effuent by achieving desired operation conditions, which are featured by the operational stability. The operating conditions for the digester correspond to organic matter degradation and are named normal operating conditions, which are computed from nontrivial equilibrium.
