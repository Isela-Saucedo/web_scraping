HoPs are extracellular EPSs and their production depends on extracellular enzymes, while HePs are intracellular EPSs. Their nature (extra or intracellular) directly impacts production rates, HoPs having higher yields. The development of processes for producing EPSs has attracted great interest, since novel application trends have emerged due to the great diversity of recent information generated on EPSs properties. HoPs have been synthesized by fermentation using bacterial cells and a cell-free enzymatic process, while HePs have been produced only by fermentation. The analysis of the EPSs production processes indicates that macronutrients such as the carbon and nitrogen source used in the culture media are very important for the synthesis of EPSs and the enzymes involved, understanding their importance can assist to design processes for production of EPSs with desirable characteristics and yields according to the needs of the processes and products to which they are applicable. This review emphasized in the analyses of carbon and nitrogen sources used for EPSs production and their functional applications and productive aspects.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2429/1249

Biotechnology applications can focus on food and its benefits for human health, either by improving the nutritional value of existing foods or developing new alternatives that can help resolve the effects of poor nutrition. The yeast Pichia pastoris has been designated as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganism and is currently used to produce a large number of recombinant proteins. In this study, a 100% synthetic protein was expressed intracellularly as a protein with high nutritional quality that contains a 75% ratio of essential amino acids using the expression system of the yeast P. pastoris. This approach might offer future possibilities for using the modified yeast as a single-cell protein source in the livestock industry and the food supplement market to reduce total protein intake.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2419/1256

Xylose, xylitol, biomass and glycerol determinations were performed by a transflection fiber optic probe, immersed in the culture broth and connected to a Near-Infrared (NIR) process analyzer. The NIR spectra recorded between 800 and 2,200 nm, these NIR Spectra were pretreated using Savitzky-Golay smoothing and second derivative in order to perform a partial least squares regression (PLSR) and generate the calibration models. These calibration models were tested by external validation and then used to predict concentrations of xylitol fermentations in batch culture. The standard errors of calibration (SEC) and determination coefficients (R2) for xylose, xylitol, biomass and glycerol were 0.234 (R2= 0.991), 0.220 (R2= 0.999), 0.234 (R2= 0.991) and 0.015 (R2= 0.999) g/L and standard errors of prediction (SEP) were 1.771, 0.192, 0.011, 0.503 g/L, respectively. Calibration and validation criteria were defined and evaluated in order to generate robust and reliable models of a xylitol fermentation process. For validation models, SEV and SEP were<10 % of initial concentration of xylose andR2>0.96 were obtained.  These results indicate that in situ NIRS probe is suitable for real-time monitoring of xylitol production.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2420/1259

However, one limitation is getting microorganisms to survive in food matrices. In this work, protective effect of exopolysaccharide produced byLactobacillus delbrueckiisubsp.bulgaricusNCFB 2772 onLactobacillus rhamnosusGG survival during semi-ripening of cheese, was analyzed. Ripening was carried out at 14 ° C for 28 days in a controlled RH chamber. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to determine interactions of probiotic with the exopolysaccharide. During ripening process, the proteolytic activity was determined through TNBS, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion-HPLC techniques. Viability of probiotic was measured by plate count. Cheese inoculated with both strains showed an improvement in probiotic survival. Exopolysaccharide was shown to have an effect on protein aggregation and cheese structural uniformity. Micrographs revealed a direct interaction between probiotic and exopolysaccharide. Proteolytic capacity did not decrease, and the generation and decrease of low molecular weight peptides (less than 3 kDa) was verified throughout the ripening process.

In the anodic compartment using a titanium plate in HNO3as an anolyte, while the electro-leaching of the metals and the evaluation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied. Three different cathodes (Platinum; Pt, titanium coated with ruthenium oxide; RuO2|Ti and titanium coated with platinum nanoparticles; nPt/C|Ti) were used for the catalysis of the evolution reaction of hydrogen (HER) in a solution of H2SO4. The results obtained by voltammetry indicate that the electrodes modified with RuO2and nPt/C, promote a greater cathodic current for the HER, decreasing the cell potential and increase the current density of the induced metallic electro-leaching. This implies the decrease of the electrical power that the reactor requires during its operation.

Some researches use apparent kinetic parameters in immobilized enzyme reactor systems, which are limited to such case studies. To enhance productivity in a packed bed reactor (PBR), a clear description of all the mechanisms (kinetic, intra-particle diffusive mass transport, fluid-particle convective mass transport, and axial dispersion) affecting the process should be established. The objective of this study was to model the isomerization of glucose in a PBR with calcium alginate beads (CAB), using an approach where the kinetic and diffusional mechanisms are described independently. The convective mass transfer (kL) and axial dispersion (Dz) coefficients were calculated from correlations. Validation was performed comparing predictions against experimental data (R2= 0.907) of glucose conversion at the reactor’s outlet once steady state was reached. Under the study conditions, in contrast to the effect exerted by diffusive mass transport on fructose specific productivity, the effect of axial dispersion and convective mass transport is negligible. Analyzing different operation parameters via simulation, the particle size had the highest impact on the glucose bioconversion. By reducing the CAB size, the surface area is increased and thus the conversion. It is recommended to test new immobilizing agents or decreasing the CAB size, monitoring that immobilizing support preserves its stability and functionality.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2474/1271

In this paper we evaluated both voltage generation and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction in municipal wastewater by one chamber MFC performed with graphite cloth electrodes and inoculated withClostridium bifermentans,Clostridium sordelliiand native bacteria.Clostridiumstrains grew properly on both Ravot medium and municipal wastewater reaching the maximum develops at 96 and 120 hours forbifermentansandsordelliirespectively. Microbial growth kinetics determined by Gompertz modified model showed low lag times for all tests.Clostridium sordelliishowed not only the maximum voltages but also the highest potential to remove organic matter from wastewater since COD diminished around 60% at the end of MFC’s operation. The addition of phosphate salts solution increased the removal of organic matter but was not efficient to generate voltage, moreover, the microorganisms present in wastewater were able to produce voltage but  the amount of organic matter removed by them were low.

Peels were sun-dried, or dried in an oven at different temperatures. The drying rate, the coloration of the dried material, and the degradation susceptibility depended on the drying mode and on temperature. Drying rate was slower for sun-dried peels, and increased at higher temperatures on oven-dried peels. Sun-dried peels were brown, while oven-dried peels were greenish. Fungal cultures grew faster on sun-dried peels and reached highest enzymatic activities earlier. Oven drying caused hornification of peels, delaying both fungal growth and enzyme production.

A viable alternative is an application of bioreactors packed with stabilized materials. In the present work, materials with two different ages were tested, which came from different closed sites. The stabilized materials (SM) were physically characterized with parameters such as humidity, volatile solids, pH, electrical conductivity and density. The bioreactor system was operated for a period of 30 weeks in two stages, by use of a complete 22factorial design. In stage I, the study factors were the hydraulic head (25 and 40 L/m3d) and the age of the SM (7 and 11 years), whereas in stage II the factors evaluated were age of the SM and type of feeding (continuous and semi-continuous). The highest average efficiency in pollutant removal was 70% for COD and 81% for BOD5and color, which corresponded to a combination of factors, namely young and stabilized materials, continuous feeding and a hydraulic load of 25 L/m3d.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate control parameters that help accelerate and improve the aerobic degradation and stabilization processes of organic waste. A mixture of pruning waste, organic fraction of municipal solid waste, paper, and sawdust was subjected to an aerobic degradation process using mature and stabilized compost from the Bordo Poniente composting plant in Mexico City at different aeration rates (0.064, 0.125, 0.201 and 0.392 L air min-1kg-1dry matter) in laboratory-scale bioreactors for 140 h.

Then, the breakthrough curves (BTC) are determined for each zeolite in a packed bed, yielding that the adsorption and capability of natural clinoptilolite is similar to those presented by artificial zeolites. The regeneration method PSA was evaluated for each zeolite. Finally, according to the experimental parameters set, a calculation of a pilot-plant scale column is included for a validation and the results are compared with the results obtained at the laboratory scale, which presented a similar behavior.

However, most of the minerals are bound with metallic elements, which lower the price of the metals of interest. Secondary materials in valuable metal extraction processes can cause various problems in the mining industry, both economic and environmental. This research aimed evaluate two treatments for the reduction of the bismuth concentration in gold and silver mineral concentrates: Bioleaching and co- precipitation with trioxide arsenic treatment, in the first, native microorganisms of the mineral to be treated were used to reduce the concentration of bismuth; in the second, arsenic trioxide was added in order to form a precipitate that contained bismuth.. The results showed that the chemical co-precipitation treatment with arsenic trioxide can decrease the Bi concentration to a greater extent compared to the bioleaching treatment, up to 16% of the initial concentration, in addition to reducing the concentration of other undesirable elements in metals such as antimony and cadmium by 32 and 11% respectively.

The morphological structure of the ACFF was analyzed by High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HRSEM). The dye removal processes were carried out discontinuously at room temperature and pH of 10, by reusing the FFCA up to 10 times. After each removal process, the ACFF was thermally treated by calcination that allowed to transform the adsorbed dye into CO and CO2wherewith its useful lifetime was extended. The results show that the adsorption process follows the Langmuir isotherm with pseudo-first order kinetics, which suggests that a chemisorption was carried out by the covalent attraction between the carbonyl groups of the ACFF and the cationic species of the dye. The novelty of the work focuses on the reuse of the ACFF for up to 10 removal cycles with a high removal rate, which can lead to a reduction in the acquisition costs of the adsorbent material.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/2444/1250

Thus, they cannot be hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and are hence classified as indigestible oligosaccharides. These molecules have gained importance due to their various applications, one of which is their prebiotic capacity. They have also been used as wall material, encapsulating bioactive compounds and releasing them at specific sites. To determine the degree of polymerization of the native fructans, FTIR,1H NMR, and MALDI–TOF-MS were used for characterization. They were subsequently modified via acetylation with acetic anhydride and tested as a carbon source with S. boulardii, which was used as a probiotic. This process helped to evaluate whether this modification affected the polysaccharide’s fermentability. The fructans used had a DP ranging from 4–10. Acetylation was performed with a change in functional groups (C = O) in the 1700–1750 cm-1region, indicating that reaction was successful.
