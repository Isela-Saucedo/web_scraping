In Mexico, this method has been made official in the Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003. During its implementation, some inconsistencies have been reported, which could have significant impacts on human health and the environment. In the present study, we carried out modifications to the stirring times and mixing ratios stated in method D3987-85. In addition, efficient sampling strategies were designed to represent more appropriately the hazardousness posed by old mining waste deposited in the tailing ponds, at El Fraile, in Taxco, Guerrero, Mexico. The characterization of these tailings shows total concentrations (in mg/kg) of potential toxic elements (EPT) in the following ranges: As (1,719.0–3,412.1), Ag (27.8–55.7), Ba (152.1–527.3), Cd (15.6–49.7), Cu (89.7–204.5), Mn (243.6–2,195.5), Pb (3,084.9–4,930.1), Zn (449.0–5,558.7); and it also shows the occurrence of the following mineral phases, in decreasing order of abundance: quartz, gypsum, potassic jarosite, phyllosilicates, hematite, potassic feldspars (sanidine). Furthermore, three samples of acid effluents (pH: 2.0–2.6) were collected in the tailings, which reported concentrations (mg/L) of SO42-(3,509.3–12,249.9), Fe (459.3–1,505.0) and potentially toxic elements (As: 0.7–1.3, Cd: 2.8–12.3, Cu: 6.1–23.7, Mn: 76.4–316, Zn: 334.5–1,262.5 ). The chemical composition of the acid effluents was compared to that of the synthetic leachates (SJA) prepared in the laboratory using the method D3987-85. According to the NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003, the acid effluents are considered hazardous when the concentration of dissolved Cd exceed the maximum permissible limit (>1.0 mg/L). However, the synthetic leachates prepared according to the method D3987-85 (18 ± 0.25h and solid-extractant ratio of 1:20) are not considered hazardous because the concentrations of dissolved Cd ranged from 0.2–0.4 mg/L. Nevertheless, when changes were made to the method D3987-85, by increasing the stirring times (24 ± 0.25 h, 48 ± 0.25 h, 72± 0.25 h, 192 ± 0.25 h) and decreasing the mixing ratios (1:10, 1:3), the concentrations of dissolved Cd increased and ranged from 0.3–2.4 mg/L. Therefore, it was proved that the synthetic leachates obtained by the modified method better represent the geochemical composition of the acid effluents collected in the field, thus contributing to a more rigorous and accurate hazardousness assessment of the tailings.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/536/648

The analysis of these deformation structures, seismites, is a key tool for the characterization of parameters such as the intensity and magnitude of the events, and the measurement of the affected area. Analysis of the shape, distribution, abundance and genesis of these secondary structures in lacustrine basins, also provide guidelines for assessing seismic hazard.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/530/651
Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas,I. Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,Carboniferous biostratigraphy of Sonora: a review,"A thorough review of the available literature regarding biostratigraphic studies on the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of Sonora, northwestern Mexico, is presented here. Most frequently reported fossils are marine invertebrates as well as protozoans and vertebrate remains. Most abundant groups are corals, both solitary and colonial, fusulinids and other foraminifera, conodonts, and brachiopods. Less commonly described groups are crinoids, algae, bryozoans, and radiolarians. This revision evidences the high paleobiodiversity and potential research interest of the Carboniferous geological record of Sonora. Although published studies including paleontological information greatly lack detailed specific taxonomic determinations or biostratigraphic analyses, the presence of all Mississippian and Pennsylvanian stages can be inferred. Regional stratigraphic gaps and hiatuses, however, are difficult to determine because of this scarcity of precise datings. Current lithostratigraphic units defined formally or informally are also reviewed.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/571/649

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Deep-water sandy fans structurally confined: Upper Cretaceous Mezcala Formation, Taxco-Atlixtac basin, northern of Guerrero State, Mexico","A detailed sedimentologic study of the Mezcala Formation allowed the differentiation of 22 sedimentary facies, the interpretation of the mechanisms of sediment transportation, environments of deposition and their relationships with the regional tectonic framework. The field study consisted of facies cartography, as well as the mapping of sandstone-shale ratios, paleocurrents and paleontological data analysis in the northern portion of the Taxco-Atlixtac basin. The facies distinction suggest gravity mass flows and episodic sheet flows related to storm periods. Sedimentary sequences are related to deep water environments. Eight facies associations constitute three Deep Sedimentary Sequences (SSP, as for their initials in spanish) and two sedimentation domains. These are, in chronostratigraphic order: Huixtac-Ojo de Agua (H-OATC) and Cerro Gordo-Taxco el Viejo (CG-TVCT). Both H-OATC and CG-TVCT domains developed erosive, mixed, and lobe depositional systems as well as transitional lobe-channels, interchannel systems, overbank and basin plain deposits.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/553/653

The present study was performed across the northern Chiapas Massif region to reconstruct its complex thermo-tectonic history from Mesozoic to present times. Basement samples and sandstones of the San Ricardo Formation derived from the Chiapas Massif Complex source area were analyzed byin situapatite fission-track dating. The new fission-track results obtained in this study, together with previously published data, indicate that the Chiapas Massif Complex, or rather the whole Maya terrane, have experienced a complex long-term geodynamic evolution with at least five post-Permian tectonic and magmatic events: (1) a Late Triassic cooling event, likely related to the initial breakup of Pangea; (2) Early Jurassic volcanism that can be linked to the Nazas volcanic arc; (3) a Middle Jurassic tectonic event that was triggered by continental rifting at the beginning of the opening of the Gulf of Mexico; (4) a Late Cretaceous to Paleocene orogeny that may actually represent the southernmost continuation of the Laramidesensu latowhich affected central and northern Mexico; and (5) the middle–late Miocene Chiapanecan event that is tectonically controlled by the interaction of the North American, Caribbean, and Cocos plates. This interpretation could be useful towards a better understanding of the geological history of southern North America. Some recommendations on sampling and analytical strategies are also given for consideration in further thermochronological studies in Chiapas.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/523/650

Físico Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Tierra,Geociencias,"Palynological study of a sedimentary profile from the middle-late Holocene, western Iberá, Corrientes, Argentina","With the denomination ""Iberá"", we identify one of the most important tropical wetlands of the biosphere in terms of its extension and living species, both animal and vegetal. The objective of this paper is to reconstruct the predominant plant communities and their variations, infer the changes in the climatic conditions that would have occurred and to deduce the depositional environment during the middle and late Holocene in the Iberá region. The profile was sampled in a ravine located in the central zone of the western margin of the Iberá System, in the locality of San Miguel. The dynamics of the vegetation and the relation of the taxa allowed establishing three pollen zones: Pollen Zone I (middle Holocene) presents a characteristic association of steppe grass. The identified lithofacies suggests a depositional environment of waterlogged valleys, which together with the recognized vegetal palaeocommunities, would indicate humid conditions for the middle Holocene. Pollen Zones II and III (late Holocene) show an association characteristic of the herbaceous psammophyte steppe. The observed Brassicaceae increase would indicate environmental disturbances, which could reflect the combination of intense wind action under an arid climate. The identified lithofacies give evidence for an eolian environment with fluvial spills and indicate together with the recognized vegetal communities, arid to semi-arid conditions for the late Holocene.",,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/,http://rmcg.geociencias.unam.mx/index.php/rmcg/article/view/531/652
