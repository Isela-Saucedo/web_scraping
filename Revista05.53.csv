Unfortunately, population growth, environmentally unfriendly industrial processes and the lack of restrictions on the production and use of toxic and/or recalcitrant compounds have led to the release of large amounts of chemical pollutants. Water resources have been particularly affected by the presence of these compounds; furthermore, the conventional wastewater treatment technologies are unable to completely remove the complex mixture of pollutants present in wastewaters. In fact, certain pollutants have been detected in drinking water at concentrations as high as 0.3 μg/L.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/259/128

These compounds confer fruity attributes to drinks. Fermented beverages contain namely two groups of esters: acetate esters formed by alcohol acetyltransferase enzymes (Atf1 and Atf2) and ethyl esters produced by the acyl-CoA ethanol O-acyltransferase enzymes (Eht1 and Eeb1), encoded by theATF1,ATF2,EHT1andEEB1genes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen addition, aeration and low temperatures on ester production during fermentation onAgave tequilanajuice in a continuous system. Low temperatures increased ethyl esters production (4.5-fold) and enhanced the expression of the involved genes (more than 3.5-fold). Conversely, when compared to aeration, the effect was negative as esters production decreased (75%) whereas theATF1,ATF2andEHT1genes were repressed (0.6-, 0.8- and 0.4-fold, respectively). The results obtained during a continuous cultivation onAgave tequilanajuice showed that production of esters occurred concomitantly with an increased gene expression, except for ethyl acetate. Therefore, the studied genes are not the only ones involved in its synthesis.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/208/130

Although MTBE can be removed by microbial consortia its removal efficiency is low due to its toxic effect on microbial growth. An alternative to enhance the MTBE degradation efficiency is by cometabolism. Yeast extract (cometabolite) was studied in the EB-MTBE-24 consortium to enhance the MTBE degradation efficiency in cultures at 110 mg L-1of MTBE and in cultures at 110 mg L-1of MTBE supplemented with 100 and 500 mg L-1of yeast extract (100YE and 500YE, respectively). The 100YE culture presented higher values of​ mmax= 0.07±0.02 h-1, degradation efficiency 77.63 ± 1.16 % and a global degradation rate 0.90 ± 0.05 h-1than the culture without YE addition. The 500YE culture presented the lowest MTBE degradation efficiency. The kinetics of MTBE degradation for the 100YE culture is described by first-order and pseudo-first-order reaction models. The cultivable fraction of the EB-MTBE-24 consortium is constituted bySphingobium barthaiiC1,Gordonia polyisoprenivoransC2, andOchrobactrum anthropiC3. The 100YE culture of the EB-MTBE-24 consortium possess a greater potential to degrade high MTBE concentrations at a high rate suggesting that the YE minimizes the MTBE inhibitory effect on microbial growth.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/293/145

The productivity, morphology parameters and chemical composition of the mushrooms, and also the chemical composition of the substrates before and after harvest were determined. The parental strainPleurotus djamor(PD) produced on WS showed the highest productivity: total weight (239.41 g), biologic efficiency (141.86 %), production rate (1.95 %) and yield (47.88 %). The hybrid strainPleurotus djamorxLentinula edodes(PD4xLC3) cultivated on AP presented the highest productivity parameters: total weight (213.18 g), biologic efficiency (120.01 %), productivity rate (2.40 %) and yield (41.10 %). All the strains presented fruit bodies with pileus diameter corresponding to Group 2 (5 - 9.9cm) and length of stipe corresponding to Group 1 (˂ 5 cm). The hybrids PO5xLC2and PD4xLC3cultivated on WS presented fruit bodies with highest protein content.

A solution to this problem could be the application of mycorremediation. So, in this workAspergillus nigerCDBB-H-175l was investigated in the discoloration (DC) of vat blue dye. A combination of statistical methodologies was applied to optimize DC; initiating with a 24-1fractional factorial design (FFD), to evaluate; dye concentration, exposure time, pH and agitation. Results showed a minimum and maximum DC of 15% and 43%, respectively. By using a first-order model DC increased further to 63%. Additional experiments enhanced DC to 90% in step 7 of a steepest ascent  design, and this was improved to 94% at a higher concentration of 521 mg/L with the application of surface response methodology. Of the 63% total DC determined in the first-order model, 28% was attributed to the glucose oxidase activity (16.5 U/mL) and the H2O2produced byA. niger, and 72% due to physisorption to the cell wall.  This is the first report where H2O2produced byAspergillus nigeris implicated in dye decoloration.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/212/152

In addition, and considering that microorganisms and plants share the pathway of synthesis of aromatic amino acids, theDhARO4gene of the enzyme Aro4p was incorporated into theNicotiana tabacumplant with the hypothesis that by doing so the plant will better face the salinity conditions resulting from irrigation with non-saline water or added with 100 mM NaCl without affecting its growth.

In the present study coffee was roasted at three air temperatures (425, 450 and 475°C) and seven different times in an innovative spouted bed system. Bean temperature was measured at the exit of the system and 5-CQA was quantified by HPLC. In order to describe the changes in concentration during the roasting process, as a function of bean temperature, an Arrhenius type kinetic model was proposed. Bean temperature was fitted to a one linear and two exponential terms equation, as a function of time and air temperature. The parameters of the kinetic model were found by a Nelder-Mead optimization technique, and were used to propose linear equations that described them as function of air temperature. The kinetic model showed good agreement with experimental data, especially at higher temperatures (R2> 0.995, RMSECV < 4%).",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/195/126

Additives decreased the equilibrium moisture content (X) and the extent of the observed hysteresis. Abrupt changes in the adsorption isotherms of the films were noted, and were very well correlated to one of the maxima of the second derivative ofXas function ofaw. Converted adsorption data for GAB regression (aw/X) generated curves with a sharp peak, linked to the isotherms inflection points.aw/Xvsawdiagrams were valuable to identify order–to-disorder transitions in pectin films. Glycerol concentration reduced the critical water activity in FGP. GAB model described adsorption isotherms above the transition (R2> 0.932), and  Halsey model exhibited a better fit (R2> 0.984).

The chemical structure of the precursor and lipophilized antioxidants was determined by 1H and 13C NMR. The derivatives of carvacrol-CLA and quercetin-CLA showed the highest yields of lipophilization. The lipophilized systems had greater lipophilicity (clog P, clog S and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) and greater antioxidant activity than the polyphenol precursors, being the carvacrol-CLA and vanillin-CLA complexes that presented the highest antioxidant activity.

The objective of this research was to study the changes in the properties of zein nanoparticles (size, z-potential, PDI, loading efficiency and pH colloidal stability) by using different copolymer coatings (sodium caseinate and pectin), ethanol concentrations (75 to 95% v/v) and solvent/antisolven or zein/krill oil ratios. Smallest particles (< 200 nm) can be obtained with the use of sodium caseinate as coating. This is the first time that zein nanospheres are used as encapsulating agents for a krill oil extract. These nanoparticles with a z-potential value around -25 mV are stable at neutral to basic pH values based on their z-potential and visual analysis. The use of pectin as coating produced the largest particles (> 400 nm) indicating that an increase in hydrophobic interactions allows the formation of bigger assemblies. Pectin-coated nanoparticles increased the LE of krill oil in about 9% compared with non-coated particles. Moreover, the krill oil/zein ratio was found to be a suitable way to increase the LE of the nanoparticles. All types of nanoparticles were capable to nano-entrap appreciable amounts of a hydrophobic krill oil extract.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/348/155

The canonical potential for the sulfidation reaction for these models is obtained and the thermodynamic stability of these catalysts   in terms of composition, temperature and pressure (pH2S/pH2) is examined. At working conditions (T=650K and pH2S/pH2=0.05) the most stable catalysts correspond to 100V75S and 100Cr100S which are structures where the promoter atoms fully replace the Nb atoms at the upper row of the single-layer crystal at the S-border.

Both types of carbon supports were impregnated with the precursor vapors at 180 ºC and 3-7 Torr inside a horizontal quartz tube reactor. Then, they were heated at 400 ºC to achieve precursor decomposition and subsequent formation of Pt nanoparticles. Carbon supports, and Pt precursor were mixed in several weight ratios. The Pt content was approximately 5, 10 and 25 wt. %. TEM observations revealed Pt particles ranging from 2.4 to 3.3 nm uniformly distributed on either nanotubes or conventional carbon support. The catalytic activity for nitrate electro-reduction (NER) was investigated in NaNO3+ NaOH solutions using Cycling Voltammetry (CV). The CV measurements showed a redox process from -0.7 to -1.0 V/SCE associated to the nitrate reduction process. It was found that Pt/MWCNTs materials display superior nitrate reduction activity than Pt/C-Vulcan XC72, even the comparable Pt decisive features.

The characterization of each sample in terms of changes produced by radiation was obtained. For this, a mineral analysis was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The EDS analysis revealed the presence of elements such as Mg, Si, Al, Ca, O, Fe, Z and Na, while the X-ray diffraction analysis suggested that the treated dolomite samples experienced slight changes in their crystalline structure when they were calcined with the CO2laser, however, there were no changes in the main phase of the dolomite but there was a decrease in the intensities of the signals. Additionally, a photocatalytic study was performed on the degradation of the Azo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5) in an acid aqueous medium using natural dolomite and natural dolomite calcined with the CO2laser.

In this work, three different synthesis methods to produce crystalline sodium metasilicate are analized; the importance of synthesizing it in powder form is to be able to incorporate it into the productive processes of the cement industry, whose equipment is made for this purpose. Silicon dioxide in stoichiometric amounts was combined with each one of the following reactant: NaHCO3, Na2CO3and NaOH. We present the most effective synthesis route to obtain sodium metasilicate based on a computational analysis and the results are validated experimentally. The characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld refinement, as well as by calorimetry and infrared and Raman spectroscopies. The experimental results were supported by molecular simulation, being both of them consistent. Using Na2CO3as a reactant was the most effective reaction.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/419/144

The highlight of this research is the use of stainless steel catalyst and organic precursors from renewable feedback for high efficient carbon nanostructures synthesis using green chemistry principles. Isopropanol and ethyl acetate were performing as precursors in the chemical vapor deposition. Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy were used to analyze the morphology and crystallinity of the synthesized nanostructures. Transmission electron microscopy performed on samples confirms the presence of multiwall carbon nanotubes and metallic particles found on the tip, base and inside the nanotubes demonstrating a mixed growth mechanism. The secondary products found in the samples were carbon nanobars with different interplanar spaces. XRD confirmed the characteristic planes for hexagonal graphite and weak iron and manganese oxides signals. EDS showed a carbon content above 94% and low metals and oxygen contribution. The carbon nanostructures crystallite sizes were calculated from XRD data and compared with the transmission electron microscopy micrographs; the structures obtained from ethyl acetate had major crystallinity. An easy to scale up carbon nanostructures synthesis method applying green chemistry principles is proposed.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/213/150

Representative gasoline hydrocarbons: iso-octane gasoline, cyclohexane, 1-hexene and pseudocumene, and alcohols: 1-butanol and 2-butanol, were used in this study. Binary mixtures were: 1-hexene + 1-butanol, cyclohexane + 1-butanol, iso-octane + 1-butanol, iso-octane + 2-butanol, pseudocumene + 1-butanol, and pseudocumene + 2-butanol. Experimental data of viscosityηwere correlated with Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation (VFT), combined with Tait's equation.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of methacrylate grafting on the structure of low methoxy citrus pectin and its gelling ability and pH sensitivity. Gellation of pectin 3 % (w/v) dispersions with 10 mM CaCl2were photocrosslinked with 10 % (w/v) Irgacure™ 2959 (265 nm UV). Bovine serum albumin was incorporated into gels by diffusion and diffusion coefficient was calculated. FT-IR spectra (1737, 1617 and 949 cm-1) suggested an efficient grafting. At pH 1.5, pectin (p) gels had higher diffusion coefficient (5.92x10-6±4x10-9cm2·s-1) than methacrylic grafted pectin (MP) gels (2.18x10-9±2x10-10cm2·s-1). At neutral pH, P gels dissolved; but MP gels displayed stability reflected in high diffusion coefficient (2.68x10-6±4x10-8cm2·s-1). The MP gels had larger pores and were 2.46 times stronger than P gels. Grafting pectins with methacrylic groups and combining photocrosslinking and ionic gelation allowed to get MP gels that overcome acidic pH sensitivity and improved the controlled release capacity.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/235/140

The IC was characterized by 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the inclusion complex formation and fiber encapsulation. The PLA-IC and PLA-CIP fibers were characterized by TGA, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The release behavior of CIP and loading efficiency percentage (LE%)were evaluated via UV-Vis at 276 nm. The LE% of CIP was higher to PLA-IC with respect to the fibers with only CIP. IC release behavior was more sustained from PLA-IC fibers versus PLA-CIP as an effect of the IC formation. The CIP was released in a more prolonged and sustained manner from PLA-IC fibers versus PLA-CIP fibers. Different PLA-CIP and PLA-IC fiber diameters did not affect the release profile. The experimental results of CIP and IC were approximated with three commonly used semi-empirical models: Korsmeyer-Peppas, zero-order, and first-order kinetic equation to explain the release mechanism.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/485/156

A surface chemical modification of fibres (SMNF) was done in order to improve its compatibility with the polymers. The structural, mechanical, thermal, optical and biodegradation properties were studied. The characterisations show that chemical treatment of fibres increases the tensile strength in the laminates with PLAa, PLAsc and TPS in a 51.4%, 21.4% and 78.1% respectively. Likewise, the elastic modulus was increased by 104%, 57.4% and 124%, respectively. On the other hand, the structural analysis shows that fibres with chemical modification have higher interfacial adhesion to polymers, improving the stability of the materials. Finally, biodegradation tests confirm that the chemical treatment delays the degradation process slightly, but materials comply with international standards for bioplastics. The properties of the laminates could be suitable for the development of trays or other semi-rigid packages for foods.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/502/158

The operational parameters researched were H2O2and HF concentrations, solid-liquid ratio, stirring speed, temperature and reaction time. The experimental results indicated that the best working conditions, with dissolution values close to 100%, were 348 K, 330 rpm, 30 min, 8 g/L, HF 0.6 M and H2O20.7 M. Thermodynamic study of the dissociation of HF in aqueous solution and EH-pH diagrams for Li-H2O, Co-H2O and Li-Co-F-H2O systems were performed.

Two series of measurements were made. One involved only human blood and the other included the addition of anticoagulant. 18 individuals (6 female, 12 male) volunteered for this experiment; their age ranged between 23 and 28 years old. All of the 18 samples were used without anticoagulant; 14 of them were also used for measurements after the addition of ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (EDTA). The results were used to simulate the pulsatile blood flow within the cardiovascular system. The classical model of Womersley was used to estimate the velocity profile and the volumetric flow; incompressible and Newtonian flow was assumed. The profiles obtained from using the experimental values of four (2 male, 2 female) of the volunteers (both samples, with and without anticoagulant) were compared. Results show that no significant differences in the profiles are found as a result of the differences in the values of the blood properties.",,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/issue/view/65,http://www.rmiq.org/ojs311/index.php/rmiq/article/view/225/147
